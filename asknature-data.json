An analysis of the molecular mechanisms of protein and mineral phases under large deformation of mineralized collagen fibrils reveals a fibrillar toughening mechanism that leads to a manifold increase of energy dissipation compared to fibrils without mineral phase.

Sprinting, swimming, and jumping performance of ectotherms decreases by at least 33% over a 10 \u00b0C drop, accompanied by a similar decline in muscle power. We propose that ballistic movements that are powered by recoil of elastic tissues are less thermally dependent than movements that rely on direct muscular power. We found that an elastically powered movement, ballistic tongue projection in chameleons, maintains high performance over a 20 \u00b0C range. Peak velocity and power decline by only 10%\u201319% with a 10 \u00b0C drop, compared to &gt;42% for nonelastic, muscle-powered tongue retraction.

A well-studied example is the formation of recruitment trails in ant colonies, but many ant species do not use pheromone trails. We present a model of the regulation of foraging by harvester ant (<em>Pogonomyrmex barbatus</em>) colonies. This species forages for scattered seeds that one ant can retrieve on its own, so there is no need for spatial information such as pheromone trails that lead ants to specific locations. Previous work shows that colony foraging activity, the rate at which ants go out to search individually for seeds, is regulated in response to current food availability throughout the colony&#8217;s foraging area. Ants use the rate of brief antennal contacts inside the nest between foragers returning with food and outgoing foragers available to leave the nest on the next foraging trip. Here we present a feedback-based algorithm that captures the main features of data from field experiments in which the rate of returning foragers was manipulated. The algorithm draws on our finding that the distribution of intervals between successive ants returning to the nest is a Poisson process. We fitted the parameter that estimates the effect of each returning forager on the rate at which outgoing foragers leave the nest. We found that correlations between observed rates of returning foragers and simulated rates of outgoing foragers, using our model, were similar to those in the data.

Such relationships have been demonstrated in several natural systems\u2026Colicinogenic [E. coli] bacteria possess a \u2018col\u2019 plasmid, containing genes that encode the colicin (the toxin), a colicin-specific immunity protein (which renders the cell immune to the colicin) and a lysis protein (which is expressed when the cell is under stress, causing partial cell lysis [the disintegration of a cell by rupture of the cell wall or membrane]and the subsequent release of the colicin). In general, only a small fraction of a population of colicinogenic cells will lyse and release the colicin. Colicin-sensitive bacteria are killed by the colicin but may occasionally experience mutations that render them resistant to the colicin. The most common mutations alter cell membrane proteins that bind or translocate the colicin. In some cases, the growth rate of resistant cells (R) will exceed that of colicinogenic cells (C), but will be less than the growth rate of sensitive cells (S). This occurs because resistant cells avoid the competitive cost of carrying the col plasmid but suffer because colicin receptor and translocation proteins are also involved in crucial cell functions such as nutrient uptake. In such cases, S can displace R (because S has a growth-rate advantage), R can displace C (because R has a growth-rate advantage) and C can displace S (because C kills S).

Diverse communities could maintain consistently high function because the species driving function change over time (functional turnover) or because they are more likely to contain key species with temporally stable functioning. Across 7 y in a large biodiversity experiment, we show that more diverse plant communities had consistently higher productivity, that is, a higher level of functioning over time. We identify the mechanism for this as turnover in the species driving biomass production; this was substantial, and species that were rare in some years became dominant and drove function in other years. Such high turnover allowed functionally more diverse communities to maintain high biomass over time and was associated with higher levels of complementarity effects in these communities.

Across 7 y in a large biodiversity experiment, we show that more diverse plant communities had consistently higher productivity, that is, a higher level of functioning over time. We identify the mechanism for this as turnover in the species driving biomass production; this was substantial, and species that were rare in some years became dominant and drove function in other years. Such high turnover allowed functionally more diverse communities to maintain high biomass over time and was associated with higher levels of complementarity effects in these communities.

It is well documented that marine fish must drink seawater to combat diffusive water loss to a hyperosmotic environment.

It is crucial, however, that the huddle structure is continuously reorganized to give each penguin a chance to spend sufficient time inside the huddle, compared with time spent on the periphery. Here we show that Emperor penguins move collectively in a highly coordinated manner to ensure mobility while at the same time keeping the huddle packed. Every 30\u201360 seconds, all penguins make small steps that travel as a wave through the entire huddle. Over time, these small movements lead to large-scale reorganization of the huddle.

Emperor penguins, Aptenodytes forsteri, use this behaviour to ensure their survival and reproduction during the Antarctic winter. An emperor penguin colony consists of a dynamic mosaic of compact zones, the so-called huddles, included in a looser network of individuals. To maximize energy savings, birds should adjust their huddling behaviour according to environmental conditions. Here, we examined the dynamics of emperor penguin aggregations, based on photo and video records, in relation to climatic factors. Environmental temperature, wind and solar radiation were the main factors contributing to huddle formation. The analysis of individual movements showed that birds originating from loose aggregations continually joined huddles. Sometimes, a small number of birds induced a movement that propagated to the entire huddle, causing its breakup within 2 min and releasing birds, which then integrated into looser aggregations. Different parts of the colony therefore appeared to continually exchange individuals in response to environmental conditions. A likely explanation is that individuals in need of warmth join huddles, whereas individuals seeking to dissipate heat break huddles apart. The regular growth and decay of huddles operates as pulses through which birds gain, conserve or lose heat. Originally proposed to account for reducing energy expenditure, the concept of social thermoregulation appears to cover a highly dynamic phenomenon that fulfils a genuine regulatory function in emperor penguins.&#8221;\u00a0 (Ancel et al. 2015: 91)</span></p>\n", "", ""], [""], [""], [""], [""], [""], [""], ["<p>\u201cThe pussmoth caterpillar browses head-down on leaves.

This solves the boxfish swimming paradox: destabilizing moments enhance manoeuvrability, which is in accordance with the ecological demands for efficient turning and tilting.\u201d (Van Wassenbergh et al. 2015:20141146)</p>\n", "<p>\u201cThe role of body-shape working with recoil-forces generated by propulsors is also well illustrated for fishes with rigid tests, such as boxfishes.

(2002, 2003) measured forces and moments in a water tunnel on whole bodies including tails of several species of boxfishes and trunkfishes and propose these contribute to stability (Bartol et al. 2008). Van Wassenbergh et al. (2015) disagree, based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and measurements on carapaces, claiming vortex-related forces are too small to be a significant factor in stabilization. The two studies used multiple but different methods that could affect the results and hence conclusions. Differences in methods include: CFD and particle image velocimetry (PIV), pressure measurement, source materials and verification in making boxfish models, inclusion of the tail, location of the CM, and sting location and shape suspending models in flows.

Within a few hours, it bursts open and starts to spread. Its margin has an up-turned rim, six inches high, so that as it expands it is able to shoulder aside any other floating leaf that gets in its way. Beneath, it is strengthened with girder-like ribs which make the whole structure rigid. They also contain air-spaces within them that keep it afloat. Expanding at the rate of half a square yard in a single day, the leaf grows until it is six feet across. The underside of the leaf is a rich purple colour and armoured with abundant sharp spikes, perhaps as a defence against leaf-eating fish. One plant can produce forty or fifty of such leaves in a single growing season and monopolise the surface so effectively that few plants of other kinds can grow alongside or below it\u2026In 1847, viable seeds did arrive at Kew and there the gardeners managed to get them to germinate.

In 1975 Vogt wrote: &#8216;Rays from an object point entering through different facets are superimposed not by refracting systems as in other superposition eyes, but by a radial arrangement of orthogonal reflecting planes which are formed by the sides of the crystalline cones and the purine layers surrounding them.&#8217; As Fig. 8.14 shows, the mirrors direct light to a common focus. Mirrors are inverters, just like the telescopes in refracting superposition eyes (Fig. 8.3b), and so the ray-bending that the two kinds of optical element perform is almost identical. However, problems start to arise when one tries to work out what will happen to rays that are not in the idealized central plane shown in Fig. 8.14b. In general, rays in oblique planes will not encounter just one side of each mirror box, but two. What happens to such rays? Do they, like the singly reflected rays in Fig. 8.14, all reach a common focus?</p>\n<p>&#8220;It turns out that the square arrangement of the facet array (almost unique to the decapod crustaceans) is crucial here. The principle is that of the &#8216;corner reflector&#8217; [like those mirrors found in corners of stores]\u2026A ray reflected from the two mirrors must be rotated through a total of two right angles, which means that it will return parallel to its original direction, <em>no matter what angle the ray initially makes with the mirror pair</em>. In other words, apart from a slight lateral displacement of the reflected ray, a corner mirror behaves as though it were a single mirror, but one that is always at right angles to the incoming ray. This property turns out to be very useful, for example in radar reflectors for ships and buoys, and it is also the property that makes reflecting superposition possible\u2026</p>\n<p>&#8220;Various other features of these eyes are important for their function. The mirror boxes must be the right depth, two to three times the width, so that most rays are reflected from two of the faces, but not more. Rays that pass straight through are intercepted by the unsilvered &#8216;tail&#8217; of the mirror boxes, and Vogt (1980) showed that its refractive index decreases in such a way that appropriate critical angle reflexion continues to occur through the clear zone. Finally, there is the weak lens in the cornea of the crayfish. This lens &#8216;pre-focuses&#8217; the light that enters the mirror box, thus given a narrower beam at the retina. All these features provide an image generally comparable in quality to that produced by refracting superposition optics (Bryceson and McIntyre), although it does seem that rays which make too many or too few reflections contribute to measurable stray light (glare) in the image of on the retina.&#8221; (Land and Nilsson 2002:172-174)</p>\n", ""], ["<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;In nature, tensile systems are reasonably common and certainly diverse in biological affinities.

Their slime is believed to act as a defence mechanism against gill-breathing predators, as it has been shown to reduce water flow over the gills of fish. Hagfish slime is composed of two interacting components, slime thread skeins and mucin vesicles, which are both released from glands along the ventrolateral length of the animal. Each slime gland is surrounded by striated muscle and a connective tissue capsule, and contains large numbers of gland thread cells and gland mucous cells. Gland thread cells contain skeins of tightly coiled polymers rich in intermediate filaments, while gland mucous cells produce vesicles containing mucins, a class of glycoproteins. Both cell types rupture partially as they pass through the slime gland duct, causing each to lose its plasma membrane, and releasing both thread skeins and mucin vesicles into the external environment. The mucin vesicles are released by holocrine secretion rather than the more typical mechanism of mucus secretion through fusion of vesicles with the membrane of the mucous cell and release of mucin granules by exocytosis. In this way, the mucin vesicles remain intact until they come into contact with seawater in the external environment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The mature slime is formed when exudate released from the hagfish contacts convectively mixing seawater.

The fully formed slime is a complex network capable of confining seawater to channels between the slime threads and ruptured mucins like a fine sieve.

Little is known about the mechanisms of vesicle rupture in seawater and stabilization within the gland, although it is believed that the vesicle membrane is permeable to most ions except polyvalent anions. We hypothesized that the most abundant compounds within the slime gland exudate have a stabilizing effect on the mucin vesicles. To test this hypothesis, we measured the chemical composition of the fluid component of hagfish slime exudate and conducted functional assays with these solutes to test their ability to keep the vesicles in a condensed state.

In vitro rupture assays demonstrated that both TMAO and betaine had a significant effect on rupture, but neither was capable of completely abolishing mucin swelling and rupture, even at high concentrations.

In combination these two factors, fruit weight and the height of the fruit bearing branches, cause a high potential energy of the hanging fruit. After the fruit is shed its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy which reaches its maximum just before impact with the ground. If the high kinetic energy was to cause the pummelos to split open when impacting with the ground, the fruits would perish within a short time due to the tropical climate in Southeast Asia, the region of origin of the genus <em>Citrus</em>.&#8221; (Fischer 2010: B659)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Semi-quantitative analyses of thin sections of pummelo peel revealed a gradual transition in density between exocarp and mesocarp.

The impact force acting on the pummelo depends on the velocity of the fruit before impact and its weight, but also on the consistency of the ground. Under natural conditions, part of the total energy is dissipated by the relatively pliable ground, as typically existing in the regions where pummelos grow naturally. In the tests presented mechanical loads acting on the fruits were increased by dropping the fruits onto a hard ground. Thus all kinetic energy must have been dissipated by the fruits themselves. The mesocarp with its air-filled intercellular spaces represents a compressible foam.

These are stiff, standard and soft states, which can be distinguished by elastic and viscous properties and by strain-dependent behaviors\u2026The mechanical parameters of the standard state are not simply the intermediate values between the stiff and the soft states, suggesting that the molecular mechanism converting the soft to the standard state is different from that converting the standard to the stiff state.&#8221; (Yamada et al. 2010:3416)</p>\n", "", "", "", ""], ["<p>&#8220;In the West, lotus (<em>Nelumbo nucifera</em> Gaertn.) is relatively little known.

Holder of the world&#8217;s record for long-term seed viability (1300 years) is a lotus fruit (China Antique) from Xipaozi, Liaoning Province, China. Five offspring of this variety, from 200-500-year-old fruits (14C dates) collected at Xipaozi, have recently been germinated, and are the first such seedlings to be raised from directly dated fruits. The fruits at Xipaozi, preserved in a dry ancient lakebed, have been exposed to low-dose \u03b3-radiation for hundreds of years (having an accumulated soil irradiation of 0.1-1.0 Gy). Offspring from these old fruits show abnormalities that resemble those in various modern seedlings irradiated at much higher doses. Although these lotus offspring are phenotypically abnormal, the viability of old seeds was evidently not affected by accumulated doses of up to 3 Gy. Growth characteristics of first- and second-year lotus offspring of these fruits, products of the longest-term radiobiological experiment on record, are summarized here (rapid early growth, phenotypic abnormalities, lack of vigour, poor rhizome development and low photosynthetic activity during second-year growth). Aspects of their chromosomal organization, phenotype and physiology (rapid recovery from stress, heat-stable proteins, protein-repair enzyme) are discussed.

First, shape isn&#8217;t held constant, but rather shape and the forces of flow interact complexly, each dependent on the other. The local wind forces on a leaf depend (in part) on its shape; its shape, in turn, depends (in part) on the local wind forces.

And now, far from harming the tree, it brings it considerable advantages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To start with, the remains of the wood, after the fungus has digested it, are in a form that the tree can absorb. So as this rotted pulp accumulates on the ground within the hollowed trunk, the oak puts out small roots into what was once its centre to reclaim some part of its lifetime savings. And there is new valuable nutriment there too. The hollow trunk has become an attractive home for animals. Bats roost in it, hanging from its walls. Owls nest there.

The change of form from solid pillar to hollow cylinder alters the way in which the trunk reacts to mechanical stress. It is much more resilient and stable. The removal of many tons of timber also reduces the strain on the tree&#8217;s elderly and doubtless somewhat decayed root system. The result is that an old hollow tree is often able to withstand a gale better than a younger undecayed one. In the ancient hunting parks of England such as Windsor, where trees stand out in the open, unprotected by others from the wind, it is by no means rare after a storm to discover that hollow oaks, four or five hundred years old, remain upright when younger ones, a quarter their age, have been blown over.

Some understory plants have well-developed lens-shaped epidermal cells, which have long been thought to increase the absorption of diffuse light. To assess the role of epidermal cell shape in capturing direct vs. diffuse light, we measured leaf reflectance and transmittance with an integrating sphere system using leaves with flat (<em>Begonia erythrophylla, Citrus reticulata, and Ficus benjamina</em>) and lens-shaped epidermal cells (<em>B. bowerae, Colocasia esculenta, </em>and<em> Impatiens velvetea</em>). In all species examined, more light was absorbed when leaves were irradiated with direct as opposed to diffuse light. When leaves were irradiated with diffuse light, more light was transmitted and more was reflected in both leaf types, resulting in absorptance values 2\u20133% lower than in leaves irradiated with direct light. These data suggest that lens-shaped epidermal cells do not aid the capture of diffuse light. Palisade and mesophyll cell anatomy and leaf thickness appear to have more influence in the capture and absorption of light than does epidermal cell shape&#8230;Lens cells may then be more important for the focusing of direct light (Vogelmann et al., 1996) or for other reasons such as storing water and improving the hydrophobicity of the leaf surface. The development of these lens-shaped cells in understory tropical species may be primarily related to chance opportunities to exposure to direct light when sun flecks penetrate to the ground level of the forest. In addition, plants with these types of cells typically have an extremely hydrophobic surface, and convexly shaped cells increase water repellency (Wagner et al., 2003; Bhushan and Jung, 2006).&#8221; (Brodersen and Vogelmann 2007:1061, 1065)</p>\n"], ["<p>&#8220;In Australia, the compass termites build castles in the shape of huge flat chisel blades, always with their long axis pointing north and south.

Barks, through tannin and cellulose, efficiently absorb radiation between 6 and 10 [microns] (Figs. 10, top and 12), which means that they emit radiation equally well in this wavelength region. It allows efficient thermal emission into the cool space via an optical atmospheric window between 7.5 and 13 [microns] (Fig. 6). Since leaves also have to cool down efficiently and therefore also have to emit radiation in this infrared optical window, it can be speculated that cellulose and tannins have been evolved, adopted, and applied because of their radiation properties. This could have been at least one of several evolutionary factors.

Many tree barks show a paper-like structure with sheets peeling off, generating highly heat-insulating, trapped air spaces between them (e.g. birch, paper-bark tree).

It&#8217;s neither a cheap nor a rapid way to go, a slug being the very paradigm of sluggishness. It is (or, strictly, was) a mysterious business. Slugs use neither cilia (as push the mucus lining our respiratory passages) nor peristaltic motion (as do, for instance, earthworms).

Any operating system that pushes needs to recover if it&#8217;s to push again\u2026At strains above 5 or 6 (higher values at higher strain rates), the mucus abruptly yields, transforming in a flash into a gooey liquid with a viscosity of 3-5 pascal-seconds&#8211;three thousand to five thousand times the viscosity of pure water. Stress falls abruptly, dropping by half, and the stress-strain curve goes flat and horizontal&#8211;stress now depends only on strain rate, as befits a fluid. Thus, the mucus can be pushed upon, propelling the slug forward, but when nudged just beyond that yield stress it turns to liquid. Then a bit of slug can slide forward across it and be ready to push backward again. Meanwhile, and critically, the mucus has to recover, to &#8216;heal&#8217; back into a viscoelastic solid, which it obligingly does forthwith. In life, a &#8216;step&#8217; is about a millimeter in length and the mucus layer is about 10 micrometers thick, so the strain gets up to around 100 during the recovery phase of each pedal wave.

The relevant combination of density and kinematic viscosity of air is much lower than for water\u2026 Analysis of published and unpublished underwater film leads us to present a hypothesis that free-ranging emperor penguins employ air lubrication in achieving high, probably maximal, underwater speeds (mean \u00b1 SD: 5.3 \u00b1 1.01 m s\u20131), prior to jumps. Here we show evidence that penguins dive to 15 to 20 m with air in their plumage and that this compressed air is released as the birds subsequently ascend whilst maintaining depressed feathers. Fine bubbles emerge continuously from the entire plumage, forming a smooth layer over the body and generating bubbly wakes behind the penguins\u2026 From simple physical models and calculations presented, we hypothesize that a significant proportion of the enhanced ascent speed is due to air lubrication reducing frictional and form drag, that buoyancy forces alone cannot explain the observed speeds\u2026\u201d (Davenport et al. 2011: 171)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Before jumping out of the water onto ice, the penguins swim at the surface and then dive on inspiration (Kooyman et al. 1971). We believe they dive with plenty of air in the plumage, with erected feathers making room for an air layer about 25 mm thick (following Du et al. 2007). Kooyman et al. (1971) described the grooming behaviour by which surface swimming emperor penguins load their plumage with air and we confirmed this by observation\u2026 They subsequently dive to ~15 to 20 m (by which depth the air volume will have decreased by a substantial amount\u2026). During the dive, or when achieving that depth, they depress the feathers (to fix the plumage volume at the new, decreased level). When the birds swim quickly upwards, the decompressing air will flow out by virtue of the available fixed plumage volume being substantially less than the initial volume. Plumage consists of a fine, multi-layered mesh over the whole of the body surface comparable to a porous medium with an estimated pore size of &lt;20 \u03bcm (Du et al. 2007), so the expanding air will automatically issue as small bubbles. This arrangement resembles the flat-plate experiments of Sanders et al. (2006), who used a 40 \u03bcm pore size sintered stainless steel strip for microbubble air injection. The \u2018active\u2019 part of the process consists solely of maintenance of depressed feathers during the near vertical phase of the ascent in order to regulate expulsion of air driven by decompression. As bubbles continue to enter the boundary layer along the plumage, they are swept downstream and move outwards, thus increasing the void fraction in the boundary layer downstream to finally leave in the wake behind the bird; or they coalesce with other bubbles to form rather large bubbles at the outer edge of the boundary layer&#8230;&#8221; (Davenport et al. 2011: 175-176)</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Emperor penguins ascending rapidly in the water column to jump onto ice shelves emit bubble clouds into the turbulent boundary layer over most of the body surface throughout their ascent.

The first\u00a0is characterized by a bubble raft without egg deposition and an\u00a0approximately linear increase in duration of mixing events with time.\u00a0This phase may reduce initial over-dispersion of foam precursor\u00a0materials until a critical concentration is achieved. The main building\u00a0phase is marked by mixing events and start-to-start intervals being\u00a0nearly constant in duration. During the final phase, mixing events do\u00a0not change in duration but intervals between them increase in an\u00a0exponential-like fashion. Pairs joining a colonial nesting abbreviate\u00a0their initial phase, presumably by exploiting a pioneer pair&#8217;s bubble\u00a0raft, thereby reducing energy and material expenditure, and time exposed\u00a0to predators. Finally, eggs are deposited only in the centre of nests\u00a0with a continuously produced, approximately 1 cm deep egg-free cortex\u00a0that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests.&#8221; (Dalgetty\u00a0&amp; Kennedy 2010:293)</p>\n", ""], ["<p>&#8220;To find water, a plant has to position its roots with just as much precision as it arranges its leaves.

Generally, structural features that alter the free volume (equivalent to pores or channels) should alter the permeation of water molecules accordingly. Resistance to diffusion is affected by the molecular mass of side chains and tends to increase with cross-linking beyond certain critical levels (Lieberman et al., 1972)\u2026The stability of cross-linkages is dependent on a large number of intermolecular forces, including covalent, ionic, and hydrogen bonding in addition to van der Waals attractive forces between non-polar amino acid side chains.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy has demonstrated that free water content in stratum corneum is greater in central regions relative to superficial and deeper cell layers at moderate levels of hydration (57%\u201387%, w/w), whereas at higher levels of hydration (300% w/w) water swells corneocytes in a direction perpendicular to the skin surface except for the deepest cell layers adjacent to the viable epidermis (Bouwstra et al., 2003a). While the mechanism excluding free water from the deeper cell layers of stratum corneum is not understood, it is speculated to play a role in preventing dehydration of the viable epidermis.

A peculiarity of the dragonfly is its use of a rowing motion along an inclined stroke plane. During hovering, the body lies almost horizontal. The wings push backward and downward, and at the end of the stroke, feather and slice upward and forward. In contrast, many other hovering insects use a symmetrical back-and-forth stroke near a horizontal stroke plane. The dragonfly\u2019s asymmetric rowing motion allows it to support much of its weight by the upward drag created during the downstroke; for the more common symmetric motion, the drag roughly cancels.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The dragonfly belongs to Odonata, one of the most ancient of insect orders. Its fore and hind wings are controlled by separate muscles, and a distinctive feature of the dragonfly\u2019s wing movement is the phase relation between those wings during various maneuvers. When hovering, the fore and hind wings tend to beat out of phase; during takeoff, they tend to beat closer in phase. Why does a dragonfly vary the phase in different maneuvers? One plausible explanation is that alternating the downstroke reduces body oscillation. That is, however, only part of the story. The fore and hind wings are about a wing-width apart\u2014close enough for them to interact hydrodynamically. To determine the amount of interaction, one solves the Navier\u2013Stokes flow equations with boundary conditions set by the movement of the wings. The resulting flows are spectacular and complex. They depend on Reynolds\u00a0number, wing motion, wing shape, and phase difference.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Despite that complexity, two general results emerge: The aerodynamic power expended is reduced when the wings move out of phase, and the force is enhanced when the wings move in phase. When the fore and hind wings beat out of phase, they approach each other from opposite sides and cross near the midstroke. The fore wings experience an induced flow due to the hind wings, and vice versa. As a consequence, the drag on the wings is reduced, as is the power expended in flapping. But the reduction in drag on the two types of wing points in opposite directions, so the net force is essentially unaffected. In other words, the counterstroking allows the dragonfly to generate nearly the same force while saving aerodynamic power. If, instead, the fore and hind wings beat in phase, they will experience a higher drag due to the induced flow. In this case the increase in drag on all the wings points in the same direction. Thus the hydrodynamic interaction results in a greater net force that can be used to accelerate as needed during takeoff.

These fall into two discernable classes based on sequence analysis and biophysical properties.

Seaside arrowgrass forms clumps up to 2 m wide and 60 cm high. Waterlogging of the plant\u2019s roots stimulates production of shallow roots that spread out at or above the surface, resulting in outward expansion of the clumps. As the clumps expand outward beyond about 40 cm, the interior shoots die out, resulting in a ring of seaside arrowgrass around a decomposing center. \u2026 The rings have higher organic content and lower water content than the surrounding substrate.

An analysis of tension in these tentacles, mathematically analogous to that applicable to suspension bridges, shows that sagging permits the tentacles to avoid increases in tension that would otherwise occur as flow increases. Force modulation was achieved by active muscular control rather than by passive material properties. Although these tentacles would certainly break in the experimental flows if they did not sag, the low tension achieved suggests that some other reason, such as limitations on the adherence of cilia and mucus, accounts for the level of tension observed. Because drag is maximum on tentacles oriented perpendicular to flow, reorientation of tentacles, either by sagging or by dangling parallel to flow, additionally reduces tension by reducing drag. Theoretical estimates of drag on tentacles oriented parallel to flow show that they are never in danger of being broken. Drag is sufficient, however, to assist in passive extension of tentacles. While reorientation is a common mode of drag reduction among marine organisms, sagging represents a novel mechanism of mediating structural forces resulting from flow.</p>\n"], [""], [""], [""], [""], [""], [""], [""], ["<p>\u201cThe eyes of some birds, insects, and fish respond to ultraviolet wavelengths.

The splendid fur of the seal, for instance, provides no protection against getting wet; it gets soaked through in the water. And, when exposed to the air, wet fur presents a considerable risk of a chill. We must assume that wet fur represents an advantage for swimming.
