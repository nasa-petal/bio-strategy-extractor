Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) often live in dark and turbid waters, where their mystacial vibrissae, or whiskers, play an important role in orientation. Besides detecting and discriminating objects by direct touch, harbor seals use their whiskers to analyze water movements, for example those generated by prey fish or by conspecifics. Even the weak water movements left behind by objects that have passed by earlier can be sensed and followed accurately (hydrodynamic trail following). While scanning the water for these hydrodynamic signals at a swimming speed in the order of meters per second, the seal keeps its long and flexible whiskers in an abducted position, largely perpendicular to the swimming direction. Remarkably, the whiskers of harbor seals possess a specialized undulated surface structure, the function of which was, up to now, unknown. Here, we show that this structure effectively changes the vortex street behind the whiskers and reduces the vibrations that would otherwise be induced by the shedding of vortices from the whiskers (vortex-induced vibrations). Using force measurements, flow measurements and numerical simulations, we find that the dynamic forces on harbor seal whiskers are, by at least an order of magnitude, lower than those on sea lion (Zalophus californianus) whiskers, which do not share the undulated structure.

Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) often live in dark and turbid waters, where their mystacial vibrissae, or whiskers, play an important role in orientation. Besides detecting and discriminating objects by direct touch, harbor seals use their whiskers to analyze water movements, for example those generated by prey fish or by conspecifics. Even the weak water movements left behind by objects that have passed by earlier can be sensed and followed accurately (hydrodynamic trail following). While scanning the water for these hydrodynamic signals at a swimming speed in the order of meters per second, the seal keeps its long and flexible whiskers in an abducted position, largely perpendicular to the swimming direction. Remarkably, the whiskers of harbor seals possess a specialized undulated surface structure, the function of which was, up to now, unknown. Here, we show that this structure effectively changes the vortex street behind the whiskers and reduces the vibrations that would otherwise be induced by the shedding of vortices from the whiskers (vortex-induced vibrations). Using force measurements, flow measurements and numerical simulations, we find that the dynamic forces on harbor seal whiskers are, by at least an order of magnitude, lower than those on sea lion (Zalophus californianus) whiskers, which do not share the undulated structure. The results are discussed in the light of pinniped sensory biology and potential biomimetic applications.\\n\\nStrategy: A harbor seal’s whiskers possess an undulated surface structure that reduces vortex-induced vibrations while moving through the water\\n\\nOrganism: harbor seal\\n\\nPart of: whiskers\\n\\nFunction: reduces vortex-induced vibrations\\n\\nMechanisms: undulated surface structure\\n\\nContext: moving through water\\n\\nText: Building a home from foam-túngara frog foam nest architecture and three-phase construction process. frogs that build foam nests floating on water face the problems of over-dispersion of the secretions used and eggs being dangerously exposed at the foam : air interface. nest construction behaviour of tungara frogs, engystomops pustulosus, has features that may circumvent these problems. pairs build nests in periodic bursts of foam production and egg deposition, three discrete phases being discernible. the first is characterized by a bubble raft without egg deposition and an approximately linear increase in duration of mixing events with time. this phase may reduce initial over-dispersion of foam precursor materials until a critical concentration is achieved. the main building phase is marked by mixing events and start-to-start intervals being nearly constant in duration. during the final phase, mixing events do not change in duration but intervals between them increase in an exponential-like fashion. pairs joining a colonial nesting abbreviate their initial phase, presumably by exploiting a pioneer pair's bubble raft, thereby reducing energy and material expenditure, and time exposed to predators. finally, eggs are deposited only in the centre of nests with a continuously produced, approximately 1 cm deep egg-free cortex that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests.\\n\\nStrategy: Túngara frogs protectively enclose hatched larvae by building nests in periodic bursts of foam production and egg deposition on water.\\n\\nOrganism: Túngara frog\\n\\nPart of: nest\\n\\nFunction: protectively encloses hatched larvae\\n\\nMechanisms: building nests\\n\\nText: DIFFERENCES IN POLYSACCHARIDE STRUCTURE BETWEEN CALCIFIED AND UNCALCIFIED SEGMENTS IN THE CORALLINE CALLIARTHRON CHEILOSPORIOIDES (CORALLINALES, RHODOPHYTA) 1. the articulated coralline calliarthron cheilosporioides manza produces segmented fronds composed of calcified segments (intergenicula) separated by uncalcified joints (genicula), which allow fronds to bend and reorient under breaking waves in the wave-swept intertidal zone. genicula are formed when calcified cells decalcify and restructure to create flexible tissue. the present study has identified important differences in the main agaran disaccharidic repeating units [\\\\u21923)-\\\\u03b2-d-galp (1\\\\u2192 4)-\\\\u03b1-l-galp(1\\\\u2192] synthesized by genicular and intergenicular segments. based on chemical and spectroscopical analyses, we report that genicular cells from c. cheilosporioides biosynthesize a highly methoxylated galactan at c-6 position with low levels of branching with xylose side stubs on c-6 of the [\\\\u21923)-\\\\u03b2-d-galp (1\\\\u2192] units, whereas intergenicular segments produce xylogalactans with high levels of xylose and low levels of 6-o-methyl \\\\u03b2-d-gal units. these data suggest that, during genicular development, xylosyl branched, 3-linked \\\\u03b2-d-galp units present in the xylogalactan backbones from intergenicular walls are mostly replaced by 6-o-methyl-d-galactose units. we speculate that this structural shift is a consequence of a putative and specific methoxyl transferase that blocks the xylosylation on c-6 of the 3-linked \\\\u03b2-d-galp units. changes in galactan substitutions may contribute to the distinct mechanical properties of genicula and may lend insight into the calcification process in coralline algae.\\n\\nStrategy: The articulated coralline Calliarthron cheilosporioides produces segmented fronds composed of calcified segments separated by uncalcified joints which allow fronds to bend and reorient under breaking waves.\\n\\nOrganism: Calliarthron cheilosporioides\\n\\nPart of: fronds\\n\\nFunction: allow fronds to bend and reorient under breaking waves\\n\\nMechanisms: segmented fronds, calcified segments, uncalcified joints\\n\\nContext: wave-swept intertidal zone\\n\\nText:{}\\n\\nStrategy:\"\n",

            "Building a home from foam—túngara frog foam nest architecture and three-phase construction process. frogs that build foam nests floating on water face the problems of over-dispersion of the secretions used and eggs being dangerously exposed at the foam : air interface. nest construction behaviour of tungara frogs, engystomops pustulosus, has features that may circumvent these problems. pairs build nests in periodic bursts of foam production and egg deposition, three discrete phases being discernible. the first is characterized by a bubble raft without egg deposition and an approximately linear increase in duration of mixing events with time. this phase may reduce initial over-dispersion of foam precursor materials until a critical concentration is achieved. the main building phase is marked by mixing events and start-to-start intervals being nearly constant in duration. during the final phase, mixing events do not change in duration but intervals between them increase in an exponential-like fashion. pairs joining a colonial nesting abbreviate their initial phase, presumably by exploiting a pioneer pair's bubble raft, thereby reducing energy and material expenditure, and time exposed to predators. finally, eggs are deposited only in the centre of nests with a continuously produced, approximately 1 cm deep egg-free cortex that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests.\n",

Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) often live in dark and turbid waters, where their mystacial vibrissae, or whiskers, play an important role in orientation. Besides detecting and discriminating objects by direct touch, harbor seals use their whiskers to analyze water movements, for example those generated by prey fish or by conspecifics. Even the weak water movements left behind by objects that have passed by earlier can be sensed and followed accurately (hydrodynamic trail following). While scanning the water for these hydrodynamic signals at a swimming speed in the order of meters per second, the seal keeps its long and flexible whiskers in an abducted position, largely perpendicular to the swimming direction. Remarkably, the whiskers of harbor seals possess a specialized undulated surface structure, the function of which was, up to now, unknown. Here, we show that this structure effectively changes the vortex street behind the whiskers and reduces the vibrations that would otherwise be induced by the shedding of vortices from the whiskers (vortex-induced vibrations). Using force measurements, flow measurements and numerical simulations, we find that the dynamic forces on harbor seal whiskers are, by at least an order of magnitude, lower than those on sea lion (Zalophus californianus) whiskers, which do not share the undulated structure. The results are discussed in the light of pinniped sensory biology and potential biomimetic applications.\\n\\nFunction: reduces vortex-induced vibrations\\n\\nMechanisms: undulated surface structure\\n\\nContext: moving through water\\n\\nText: {}\\n\\nFunction:\"\n",

Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) often live in dark and turbid waters, where their mystacial vibrissae, or whiskers, play an important role in orientation. Besides detecting and discriminating objects by direct touch, harbor seals use their whiskers to analyze water movements, for example those generated by prey fish or by conspecifics. Even the weak water movements left behind by objects that have passed by earlier can be sensed and followed accurately (hydrodynamic trail following). While scanning the water for these hydrodynamic signals at a swimming speed in the order of meters per second, the seal keeps its long and flexible whiskers in an abducted position, largely perpendicular to the swimming direction. Remarkably, the whiskers of harbor seals possess a specialized undulated surface structure, the function of which was, up to now, unknown. Here, we show that this structure effectively changes the vortex street behind the whiskers and reduces the vibrations that would otherwise be induced by the shedding of vortices from the whiskers (vortex-induced vibrations). Using force measurements, flow measurements and numerical simulations, we find that the dynamic forces on harbor seal whiskers are, by at least an order of magnitude, lower than those on sea lion (Zalophus californianus) whiskers, which do not share the undulated structure. The results are discussed in the light of pinniped sensory biology and potential biomimetic applications.\\n\\nFunction: reduces vortex-induced vibrations\\n\\nMechanism: undulated surface structure\\n\\nContext: moving through water\\n\\nText: Building a home from foam-túngara frog foam nest architecture and three-phase construction process. frogs that build foam nests floating on water face the problems of over-dispersion of the secretions used and eggs being dangerously exposed at the foam : air interface. nest construction behaviour of tungara frogs, engystomops pustulosus, has features that may circumvent these problems. pairs build nests in periodic bursts of foam production and egg deposition, three discrete phases being discernible. the first is characterized by a bubble raft without egg deposition and an approximately linear increase in duration of mixing events with time. this phase may reduce initial over-dispersion of foam precursor materials until a critical concentration is achieved. the main building phase is marked by mixing events and start-to-start intervals being nearly constant in duration. during the final phase, mixing events do not change in duration but intervals between them increase in an exponential-like fashion. pairs joining a colonial nesting abbreviate their initial phase, presumably by exploiting a pioneer pair's bubble raft, thereby reducing energy and material expenditure, and time exposed to predators. finally, eggs are deposited only in the centre of nests with a continuously produced, approximately 1 cm deep egg-free cortex that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests.\\n\\nFunction: protectively encloses hatched larvae\\n\\nMechanism: building nests\\n\\nContext: periodic bursts of foam production on water\\n\\nText: {}\\n\\nFunction:\"\n",
