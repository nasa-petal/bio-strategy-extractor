This study shows that although annual fluctuations occur in the main prey types of Skomer Puffins, food availability does not appear to limit breeding success. Most birds found food close to the colony, showing peaks of activity early in the day and again in late afternoon; and two out of four experimental pairs were able to rear 'twins', though the growth-rates of these were less than for single chicks. Some interesting observations are given on the feeding of the chick and on kleptoparasitism of adults by Jackdaws and gulls.
