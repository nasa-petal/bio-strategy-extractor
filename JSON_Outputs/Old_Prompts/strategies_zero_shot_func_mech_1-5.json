{"W2103410568": " The t\u00fangara frog is trying to build a home from foam in order to protect its eggs.\n\nMechanism: The t\u00fangara frog builds its home by creating a bubble raft in order to reduce the over-dispersion of foam precursor materials. The frog then enters the main building phase, marked by mixing events and start-to-start intervals that are nearly constant in duration. Finally, the frog deposits its eggs in the center of the nest and creates a continuously produced egg-free cortex that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests.", "W2138292607": " The greater mouse-eared bat is trying to calibrate a magnetic compass by the sun in order to navigate to a home roost.\n\nMechanism: The bat detects the geomagnetic field and uses it to indicate direction and locate position.", "W2005539166": " The function of the organism is to be able to see the contrast between adjacent stripes in the polarizing drum.\n\nMechanism: The mechanism of the organism is that it has polarizing filters in its photoreceptors that allow it to see the contrast between adjacent stripes.", "W2151557512": " The organism is trying to accomplish the degradation of crystalline cellulose.\n\nMechanism: The organism does this by using a multidomain hyperthermophilic cellulase.", "W2160542693": " The organism is trying to create flexible tissue.\n\nMechanism: The organism does this by biosynthesizing a highly methoxylated galactan."}
