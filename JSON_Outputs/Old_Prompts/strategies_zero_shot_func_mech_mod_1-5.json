{"W2103410568": " The t\u00fangara frog is trying to build a home from foam in order to protect its eggs.\n\nMechanism: The t\u00fangara frog builds its home by creating a bubble raft in order to reduce the initial over-dispersion of foam precursor materials. The frog then enters the main building phase, during which mixing events and start-to-start intervals are nearly constant in duration. Finally, the frog deposits its eggs in the center of the nest and creates a continuously produced egg-free cortex that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests.", "W2138292607": " The greater mouse-eared bat is trying to calibrate a magnetic compass by the sun in order to navigate to a home roost.\n\nMechanism: The bat detects the geomagnetic field and uses it to indicate direction and locate position. The magnetic field is used to calibrate the compass by the sun.", "W2005539166": " The function of the organism is to be able to see the contrast between adjacent stripes in the polarizing drum.\n\nMechanism: The mechanism of the organism is that it has polarizing filters in its photoreceptors that allow it to see the contrast between adjacent stripes.", "W2151557512": " The organism is trying to accomplish the degradation of crystalline cellulose.\n\nMechanism: The organism uses a multidomain hyperthermophilic cellulase to break down the cellulose into smaller pieces that can be used as an energy source.", "W2160542693": " The organism is trying to create flexible tissue.\n\nMechanism: The organism produces a highly methoxylated galactan at c-6 position with low levels of branching with xylose side stubs on c-6 of the [\u21923)-\u03b2-d-galp (1\u2192] units, whereas intergenicular segments produce xylogalactans with high levels of xylose and low levels of 6-o-methyl \u03b2-d-gal units."}
