{"W2103410568": "\nThe t\u00fangara frog is trying to build a home that will protect its eggs from predators.\n\nMechanism:\n\nThe t\u00fangara frog builds its home by secreting a foam that floats on water. The foam hardens to form a protective layer around the eggs.", "W2138292607": "\nThe greater mouse-eared bat is calibrating a magnetic compass by the sun. This allows the bat to orient itself and navigate to a home roost.\n\nMechanism:\n\nThe bat is able to detect the geomagnetic field and use it to orient itself. The exact mechanism by which the bat does this is not fully understood, but it is thought that the bat uses the sun as a reference point.\n\nName:\n\nGreater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis)", "W2005539166": "\nThe function of this organism is to be able to see the contrast between adjacent stripes in a polarizing drum. This allows the cuttlefish to better navigate its environment and avoid predators.\n\nMechanism:\n\nThe mechanism by which this organism accomplishes this function is by having photoreceptors that are sensitive to polarization. This allows the cuttlefish to see the contrast between the stripes and better navigate its environment.", "W2151557512": "\nThe function of the organism is to degrade cellulose.\n\nMechanism:\n\nThe mechanism of the organism is to use enzymes to break down the cellulose molecule.\n\nName:\n\nThe name of the organism is an archaeon.", "W2160542693": "\nThe organism is trying to create flexible tissue that can bend and reorient under breaking waves.\n\nMechanism:\n\nThe organism produces xylogalactans, which are highly methoxylated galactans with low levels of branching and xylose side stubs. These xylogalactans replace the 3-linked \u03b2-d-galp units in the intergenicular walls, resulting in the flexibility of the tissue."}
