{"W2103410568": " The t\u00fangara frog is trying to build a home from foam in order to protect its eggs.\n\nMechanism: The t\u00fangara frog builds its home by creating a bubble raft without egg deposition in the first phase, which may reduce initial over-dispersion of foam precursor materials until a critical concentration is achieved. The main building phase is marked by mixing events and start-to-start intervals being nearly constant in duration. During the final phase, mixing events do not change in duration but intervals between them increase in an exponential-like fashion.", "W2138292607": " The greater mouse-eared bat is trying to calibrate a magnetic compass by the sun in order to navigate to a home roost.\n\nMechanism: The bat detects the geomagnetic field and uses it to indicate direction and locate position. The magnetic field is used to calibrate the compass by the sun.", "W2005539166": " The function of the organism is to be able to see the contrast between adjacent stripes in the polarizing drum.\n\nMechanism: The mechanism of the organism is that it has polarizing filters in its photoreceptors that allow it to see the contrast between adjacent stripes.", "W2151557512": " The organism is trying to accomplish the degradation of crystalline cellulose.\n\nMechanism: The organism uses a multidomain hyperthermophilic cellulase to break down the cellulose into smaller pieces that can be used as an energy source.", "W2160542693": " The organism is trying to create flexible tissue.\n\nMechanism: The organism produces a highly methoxylated galactan at the c-6 position with low levels of branching with xylose side stubs on c-6 of the [\u21923)-\u03b2-d-galp (1\u2192] units.", "W2130285640": " The t\u00fangara frog is trying to create a safe environment for its eggs to incubate and grow. \n\nMechanism: The t\u00fangara frog produces a foam from six proteins which creates a physical barrier against environmental and microbiological threats. Three of the proteins are lectins, which are proteins that can bind carbohydrates, and act as a defense against microbial colonization. The other three proteins are cystatins, which are proteins that can inhibit proteinases, and act as a defense against insect attack. The foam also contains a surfactant protein, which lowers the surface tension of the foam and makes it more stable.", "W2168114966": " The suctorial organ of the Solifugae is used for prey capture.\n\nMechanism: The suctorial organ is a palpal organ that is used to climb smooth, vertical surfaces. The histological examination illustrates the internal gross anatomy of this structure and scanning electron microscopy demonstrates the fine structure in adults of four genera: eremobates (eremobatidae), eremochelis (eremobatidae), eremorhax (eremobatidae), ammotrechula (ammotrechidae), as well as an unidentified late stage immature and third stage instar.", "W1589686983": " The function of the organism is to study the tracer methods of air movement in mounds and nests.\n\nMechanism: The mechanism of the organism is to use wind speed and wind direction to create a tidal movement of air. This movement of air then ventilates the nests.", "W2096244860": " The function of the organism is to digest hemoglobin as a source of nutrition.\n\nMechanism: The mechanism of the organism is that it uses a multi-enzyme, synergistic cascade of proteolysis to digest hemoglobin.", "W2052657884": " The function of an organism with a hydrostatic skeleton is to provide support, movement, and muscular antagonism, as well as to amplify the force and displacement of muscle contraction.\n\nMechanism: The mechanism of an organism with a hydrostatic skeleton is that force is transmitted not through rigid skeletal elements but instead by internal pressure. The functioning of these systems depends on the fact that they are essentially constant in volume as they consist of relatively incompressible fluids and tissue. Contraction of muscle and the resulting decrease in one of the dimensions thus results in an increase in another dimension. By actively (with muscle) or passively (with connective tissue) controlling the various dimensions, a wide array of deformations, movements and changes in stiffness can be created."}
