{"W2103410568": " The t\u00fangara frog is trying to build a home from foam in order to protect its eggs.\n\nMechanism: The t\u00fangara frog builds its foam nest by producing secretions and mixing them with air to create bubbles. The bubbles are then deposited in a central location in the nest.\n\nContext: The t\u00fangara frog builds its foam nest in a body of water, such as a pond or lake.", "W2138292607": " The greater mouse-eared bat is trying to calibrate a magnetic compass by the sun.\n\nMechanism: The bat detects the geomagnetic field and uses it to navigate to a home roost. The geomagnetic field is used by animals to indicate direction and to locate position.\n\nContext: The bat is calibrating the magnetic compass with sunset cues.", "W2005539166": " The function of the organism is to be able to see the contrast between adjacent stripes in the polarizing drum.\n\nMechanism: The mechanism of the organism is that it has polarizing filters in its photoreceptors that allow it to see the contrast between adjacent stripes.\n\nContext: The context of the organism is that it is free-moving and able to see the polarizing optomotor stimulus.", "W2151557512": " The function of the organism is to identify and characterize a multidomain hyperthermophilic cellulase from an archaeal enrichment.\n\nMechanism: The mechanism of the organism is to use a wide range of carbon and energy sources.\n\nContext: The context of the organism is to grow at temperatures above 90 \u00b0c using crystalline cellulose as a carbon source.", "W2160542693": " The organism is trying to create flexible tissue.\n\nMechanism: The organism does this by decalcifying and restructuring calcified cells.\n\nContext: The organism is performing this function in the wave-swept intertidal zone."}
