{"W2103410568": " The t\u00fangara frog is trying to build a home for its eggs.\n\nMechanism: The frog secretes a foam that it uses to build the nest. The foam is produced in bursts, and the egg is deposited in the center of the nest.\n\nContext: The frog builds the nest on water.\n\nPart of the organism: The frog's body secretes the foam.", "W2138292607": " The greater mouse-eared bat is trying to calibrate a magnetic compass by the sun.\n\nMechanism: The greater mouse-eared bat detects the geomagnetic field and uses it to navigate to a home roost.\n\nContext: The greater mouse-eared bat is performing this function in a nocturnal environment.\n\nPart of the organism: The greater mouse-eared bat's brain is performing the mechanism.", "W2005539166": " The function of the organism is to be able to see the contrast between adjacent stripes in the polarizing drum.\n\nMechanism: The mechanism of the organism is that it has polarizing filters in its photoreceptors that allow it to see the contrast between adjacent stripes.\n\nContext: The context of the organism is that it is free-moving and able to see the polarizing optomotor stimulus.\n\nPart: The part of the organism that is performing the mechanism is the photoreceptor.", "W2151557512": " The function of the organism is to identify and characterize a multidomain hyperthermophilic cellulase from an archaeal enrichment.\n\nMechanism: The mechanism of the organism is to use a wide range of carbon and energy sources.\n\nContext: The context of the organism is to grow at temperatures above 90 \u00b0c using crystalline cellulose as a carbon source.\n\nPart: The part of the organism that is performing the mechanism is the archaeal consortium.", "W2160542693": " The organism is trying to create flexible tissue.\n\nMechanism: The organism produces a highly methoxylated galactan at the c-6 position with low levels of branching and xylose side stubs.\n\nContext: The organism is performing this function in the intertidal zone.\n\nPart of the organism: The genicular cells are performing the mechanism."}
