# Prompt Engineering with GPT-3

This repository contains the prompt engineering with GPT-3 to extract biological strategies from the research paper dataset.
This is only a small proportion of the prompt engineering. Please check Box for the complete experiment.

Essentially, the goal of this prompt engineering to extract a biological strategy.

A biological strategy is a characteristic, mechanism, or process that an organism or ecosystem exhibits to accomplish a particular function within a particular context.

The main elements of a biological strategy are:

- The function of the organism, as in what is the organism trying to accomplish?
- The mechanism of the organism, or how the organism does the function.
- The context of the organism performing the function. This could be a place, condition, or situation.
- The organism or ecosystem is performing the function.
- The part of the organism that is used to perform the function.
