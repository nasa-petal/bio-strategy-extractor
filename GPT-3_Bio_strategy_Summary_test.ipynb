Even the weak water movements left behind by objects that have passed by earlier can be sensed and followed accurately (hydrodynamic trail following). While scanning the water for these hydrodynamic signals at a swimming speed in the order of meters per second, the seal keeps its long and flexible whiskers in an abducted position, largely perpendicular to the swimming direction.

Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) often live in dark and turbid waters, where their mystacial vibrissae, or whiskers, play an important role in orientation. Besides detecting and discriminating objects by direct touch, harbor seals use their whiskers to analyze water movements, for example those generated by prey fish or by conspecifics. Even the weak water movements left behind by objects that have passed by earlier can be sensed and followed accurately (hydrodynamic trail following). While scanning the water for these hydrodynamic signals at a swimming speed in the order of meters per second, the seal keeps its long and flexible whiskers in an abducted position, largely perpendicular to the swimming direction. Remarkably, the whiskers of harbor seals possess a specialized undulated surface structure, the function of which was, up to now, unknown. Here, we show that this structure effectively changes the vortex street behind the whiskers and reduces the vibrations that would otherwise be induced by the shedding of vortices from the whiskers (vortex-induced vibrations). Using force measurements, flow measurements and numerical simulations, we find that the dynamic forces on harbor seal whiskers are, by at least an order of magnitude, lower than those on sea lion (Zalophus californianus) whiskers, which do not share the undulated structure. The results are discussed in the light of pinniped sensory biology and potential biomimetic applications.\\n\\nStrategy: A harbor seal’s whiskers possess an undulated surface structure that reduces

water face the problems of over-dispersion of the secretions used and eggs being dangerously exposed at the foam : air interface. nest construction behaviour of tungara frogs, engystomops pustulosus, has features that may circumvent these problems. pairs build nests in periodic bursts of foam production and egg deposition, three discrete phases being discernible. the first is characterized by a bubble raft without egg deposition and an approximately linear increase in duration of mixing events with time. this phase may reduce initial over-dispersion of foam precursor materials until a critical concentration is achieved. the main building phase is marked by mixing events and start-to-start intervals being nearly constant in duration. during the final phase, mixing events do not change in duration but intervals between them increase in an exponential-like fashion. pairs joining a colonial nesting abbreviate their initial phase, presumably by exploiting a pioneer pair's bubble raft, thereby reducing energy and material expenditure, and time exposed to predators. finally, eggs are deposited only in the centre of nests with a continuously produced, approximately 1 cm deep egg-free cortex that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests.\\n\\nStrategy: Túngara frogs protectively enclose hatched larvae by building nests in periodic bursts of foam production

STRUCTURE BETWEEN CALCIFIED AND UNCALCIFIED SEGMENTS IN THE CORALLINE CALLIARTHRON CHEILOSPORIOIDES (CORALLINALES, RHODOPHYTA) 1. the articulated coralline calliarthron cheilosporioides manza produces segmented fronds composed of calcified segments (intergenicula) separated by uncalcified joints (genicula), which allow fronds to bend and reorient under breaking waves in the wave-swept intertidal zone. genicula are formed when calcified cells decalcify and restructure to create flexible tissue. the present study has identified important differences in the main agaran disaccharidic repeating units [\\\\u21923)-\\\\u03b2-d-galp (1\\\\u2192 4)-\\\\u03b1-l-galp(1\\\\u2192] synthesized by genicular and intergenicular segments. based on chemical and spectroscopical analyses, we report that genicular cells from c. cheilosporioides biosynthesize a highly methoxylated galactan at c-6 position with low levels of branching with xylose side stubs on c-6 of the [\\\\u21923)-\\\\u03b2-d-galp (1\\\\u2192] units, whereas intergenicular segments produce xylogalactans with high levels of xylose and low levels of 6-o-methyl \\\\u03b2-d-gal units. these data suggest that, during genicular development, xylosyl branched, 3-linked \\\\u03b2-d-galp units present in the xylogalactan backbones from intergenicular walls are mostly replaced by 6-o-methyl-d-galactose units. we speculate that this structural shift is a consequence of a putative and specific methoxyl transferase that blocks the xylosylation on c-6 of the 3-linked \\\\u03b2-d-galp units. changes in galactan substitutions may contribute to the distinct mechanical properties of genicula and may lend insight into the calcification process in coralline algae.\\n\\nStrategy: The articulated coralline Calliarthron

Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) often live in dark and turbid waters, where their mystacial vibrissae, or whiskers, play an important role in orientation. Besides detecting and discriminating objects by direct touch, harbor seals use their whiskers to analyze water movements, for example those generated by prey fish or by conspecifics. Even the weak water movements left behind by objects that have passed by earlier can be sensed and followed accurately (hydrodynamic trail following). While scanning the water for these hydrodynamic signals at a swimming speed in the order of meters per second, the seal keeps its long and flexible whiskers in an abducted position, largely perpendicular to the swimming direction. Remarkably, the whiskers of harbor seals possess a specialized undulated surface structure, the function of which was, up to now, unknown.

frog (engystomops pustulosus) form a biocompatible incubation medium for eggs and sperm while resisting considerable environmental and microbiological assault. we have shown that much of this behaviour can be attributed to a cocktail of six proteins, designated ranaspumins (rsn-1 to rsn-6), which predominate in the foam. these fall into two discernable classes based on sequence analysis and biophysical properties. rsn-2, with an amphiphilic amino acid sequence unlike any hitherto reported, exhibits substantial detergent-like surfactant activity necessary for production of foam, yet is harmless to the membranes of eggs and spermatozoa. a further four (rsn-3 to rsn-6) are lectins, three of which are similar to fucolectins found in teleosts but not previously identified in a land vertebrate, though with a carbohydrate binding specificity different from previously described fucolectins. the sixth, rsn-1, is structurally similar to proteinase inhibitors of the cystatin class, but does not itself appear to exhibit any such activity. the nest foam itself, however, does exhibit potent cystatin activity. rsn-encoding genes are transcribed in many tissues of the adult frogs, but the full cocktail is present only in oviduct glands. combinations of lectins and cystatins have known roles in plants and animals for defence against microbial colonization and insect attack. tungara nest foam displays a novel synergy of selected elements of innate defence plus a specialized surfactant protein, comprising a previously unreported strategy for protection of unattended reproductive stages of animals.\\n\\nContext: while resisting considerable environmental and microbiological assault\\n\\nText: A multi-enzyme cascade of hemoglobin proteolysis in the intestine of blood-feeding hookworms.blood-feeding pathogens digest hemoglobin (hb) as a source of nutrition, but little is known about this process in multicellular parasites. the intestinal brush border membrane of the canine hookworm, ancylostoma caninum, contains aspartic proteases (apr-1), cysteine proteases (cp-2), and metalloproteases (mep-1), the first of which is known to digest hb. we now show that hb is degraded by a multi-enzyme, synergistic cascade of proteolysis. recombinant apr-1 and cp-2, but not mep-1, digested native hb and denatured globin. mep-1, however, did cleave globin fragments that had undergone prior digestion by apr-1 and cp-2. proteolytic cleavage sites within the hb \\\\u03b1 and \\\\u03b2 chains were determined for the three enzymes, identifying a total of 131 cleavage sites. by scanning synthetic combinatorial peptide libraries with each enzyme, we compared the preferred residues cleaved in the libraries with the known cleavage sites within hb. the semi-ordered pathway of hb digestion described here is surprisingly similar to that used by plasmodium to digest hb and provides a potential mechanism by which these hemoglobinases are efficacious vaccines in animal models of hookworm infection.\\n\\nContext: blood-feeding pathogens\\n\\nText: On the Mound of Macrotermes michaelseni as an Organ of Respiratory Gas Exchange. patterns and rates of air movements in the mounds and nests of macrotermes michaelseni were studied using tracer methods. wind is a significant source of energy for powering nest ventilation, despite the mound being a completely enclosed structure. nests are ventilated by a tidal movement of air driven by temporal variation in wind speed and wind direction. density gradients sufficiently steep to drive bulk flow by natural convection will be rare. however, metabolism-induced buoyant forces may interact with wind energy in a way that promotes homeostasis of the mound atmosphere.\\n\\nContext:  tidal movement of

Piscivorous birds have a unique suite of adaptations to forage under the water. One method aerial birds use to catch fish is the plunge dive, wherein birds dive from a height to overcome drag and buoyancy in the water. The kingfishers are a well-known clade that contains both terrestrially foraging and plunge-diving species, allowing us to test for morphological and per- formance differences between foraging guilds in an evolutionary context. Diving species have narrower bills in the dorsoventral and sagittal plane and longer bills (size-corrected data, n 1⁄4 71 species, p , 0.01 for all). Although these differences are confounded by phylogeny (phylogenetically corrected ANOVA for dorsoventral p1⁄40.26 and length p1⁄40.14), beak width in the sagittal plane remains statistically different ( p , 0.001). We examined the effects of beak morphology on plunge performance by phys- ically simulating dives with three-dimensional printed models of beaks coupled with an accelerometer, and through computational fluid dynamics (CFD). From physically simulated dives of bill models, diving species have lower peak decelerations, and thus enter the water more quickly, than terres- trial and mixed-foraging species (ANOVA p 1⁄4 0.002), and this result remains unaffected by phylogeny (phylogenetically corrected ANOVA p1⁄40.05). CFD analyses confirm these trends in three representative species and indi- cate that the morphology between the beak and head is a key site for reducing drag in aquatic species.\"]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":103,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":613,"status":"ok","timestamp":1669703705962,"user":{"displayName":"Eshan Bhargava","userId":"11618991347122399879"},"user_tz":480},"id":"yMP9HqTpRnxJ"},"outputs":[],"source":["def run_gpt_single(example, fname, prompt, top_p, max_tokens):\n","  response = openai.Completion.create(\n","        model=\"text-davinci-002\",\n","        prompt=prompt.format(example[0]),\n","        temperature=0,\n","        max_tokens=max_tokens,\n","        top_p=top_p,\n","        frequency_penalty=0,\n","        presence_penalty=0\n","      )\n","  d = response[\"choices\"][0][\"text\"]\n","\n","  with open(\"gdrive/MyDrive/NASA/GPT/JSON_Files/\"+ fname+\".json\", \"w\") as outfile:\n","      json.dump(d, outfile)\n","\n","def get_single_summary(fname):\n","  strategy = open(\"gdrive/MyDrive/NASA/GPT/JSON_Files/\"+fname+\".json\")\n","  data = json.load(strategy)\n","  return data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":104,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":20,"status":"ok","timestamp":1669703705963,"user":{"displayName":"Eshan Bhargava","userId":"11618991347122399879"},"user_tz":480},"id":"BqJ7A6PI7jmd"},"outputs":[],"source":["# run_gpt_single(kingfisher_example, \"kingfisher_context_4_final\", prompt, 1, 256)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":105,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":20,"status":"ok","timestamp":1669703705963,"user":{"displayName":"Eshan Bhargava","userId":"11618991347122399879"},"user_tz":480},"id":"m8ynxLC84qWv"},"outputs":[],"source":["sample = get_single_summary(\"kingfisher_context_4_final\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":106,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":19,"status":"ok","timestamp":1669703705963,"user":{"displayName":"Eshan Bhargava","userId":"11618991347122399879"},"user_tz":480},"id":"JSXRo7rL5hhy","outputId":"0b255e5c-174d-43dd-80e1-45b10deeb78d"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":[" to catch fish\n","Mechanism: plunge dive\n","Timing: when the bird is diving\n","Context: piscivorous birds have a unique suite of adaptations to forage under the water\n","Environment: in the water\n","Part of: beak\n","Organism: kingfishers\n","Strategy: Kingfishers catch fish by plunging into the water from a height to overcome drag and buoyancy.
