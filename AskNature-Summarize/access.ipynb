      "“The Eurasian diving bell spider Argyroneta aquatica (Clerck 1757) (Cybaeidae) is a unique spider that is said to live its entire life underwater. Their book lungs and tracheal system utilize air that is trapped at the surface of the water by hydrophobic hairs on the abdomen (opisthosoma) and the ventral side of the cephalothorax (prosoma) (Fig.1A) (Levi, 1967; Messner and Adis, 1995). Moreover, they construct silk webs on underwater vegetation and create an air-filled bubble, the ‘diving bell’ (Fig 1B). The air is held by surface tension between the silk fibres, and the chamber is open on the bottom. Smaller diving bells accommodate the abdomen only, but larger ones allow the whole spider to move in and out through the bottom. They fill the bell by sequentially carrying large bubbles from the surface, held with the abdomen and fine hairs on the rear legs.” (Seymore & Hetz 2011:2175)\n",

Due to the hydrophilic property of the web, small air bubbles could not pass this composite and remained perfectly spherical at the contact point. As revealed using Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the hydrogel and the silken threads are proteinaceous. The spider uses the web as a diving bell by transporting air bubbles to a small area underneath such a sheet-web, and by additional spinning activities.” (Neumann & Kureck 2013:1)\n",

Although it has often been assumed that drying of newly spun silk causes it to shrink and, in the process, to generate the forces needed to manipulate leaves showed that this is not the case. Leaf shelter-building caterpillars impart potential energy to their silk strands by stretching them beyond their equilibrium length as they are spun out. Axial retraction of the stretched strands then draws the bound plant surfaces together. Although a single stretched strand exerts only a minuscule force, the combined force generated by many such strands attached to the same opposable plant surfaces is substantial and allows the caterpillars to manipulate leaves many times their size and mass.

Special subsets of chlorophyll molecules in these photosystems are excited by light energy, allowing electrons on them to be transferred through a series of redox carriers called the electron transfer chain (ETC), beginning from the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of PSII (which oxidizes H2O and releases O2 and protons) (Diner and Babcock, 1996), through the plastoquinone (PQ) pool, the cytochrome (cyt) b6f complex (Sacksteder et al., 2000) and plastocyanin (PC), and finally through PSI (Malkin, 1996).

We demonstrate that tension is actively generated in C. hirsuta fruit by the anisotropic deformation of living cells that sustain turgor pressure. This unusual mechanism relies on a combination of three-dimensional cellular geometry and anisotropic cell wall properties of the fruit epidermis. Moreover, we show that the stored potential energy giving rise to tissue tension is released explosively via coiling of the fruit valves. This coiling mechanism requires the asymmetric localization of lignin in a single cell layer of the valve and represents an evolutionary novelty associated with explosive seed dispersal across the genus Cardamine.”\n",

Cells in the inner (endocarp b) layer of the valve are asymmetrically thickened by a lignified secondary cell wall on their inner face. Lignin is precisely deposited in these cells to form three stiff rods connected by very thin hinges. The fruit valve needs to coil along its length to reach its relaxed state, but its transverse curvature prevents this. Opening these hinged cell walls flattens the cross-section of the valve, which removes this energy barrier, allowing the sudden release of elastic energy. Toy slap bracelets, for example, work by a similar principle.”\n",

Where hexagons do occur on curved surfaces — such as in the beautifully delicate skeletons of some microscopic marine organisms called Radiolaria — there are always some other shapes and angles inserted to compensate for the curvature. The same is true of the tortoise’s shell, where remarkably regular hexagons in the centre are bounded by pentagons (five-sided shapes) which fuse to give a straight edge to the shell; exactly the same happens in insect wings.

Giant larvaceans in the genus Bathochordaeus are generally an order of magnitude larger (at 3- to 10-cm total length as adults), and they create large houses that can exceed 1 m in greatest dimension. Bathochordaeus houses consist of an outer structure that excludes large particles and a fine-mesh inner filter to concentrate particles of the appropriate size for ingestion. The inner filter of a Bathochordaeus house has a tail chamber that receives the particle-laden water propelled by the animal’s beating tail. The tail chamber directs water into the two fluted arms of the inner feeding filter, where particles are entrained and carried into the animal’s mouth via a buccal tube. When its feeding structure becomes clogged, a larvacean discards its mucus house and builds another. For smaller species, this can occur on an hourly basis; for giant larvaceans, replacement intervals can be daily. Discarded houses are typically rich in nutrients; large ones collapse and sink rapidly to the deep seafloor, circumventing the microbial degradation that mineralizes the organic content of smaller, more slowly sinking detritus. Through this process, giant larvaceans contribute significantly to the biological pump and can be regionally responsible for as much as one-third of the carbon flux from near-surface waters to the deep benthos.” (Katija et al. 2017: 1)\n",

The outlines of bones, therefore, follow the stress lines or are vertical to them so that they give an indication of the pressures the bone has to withstand. But this ideal distribution of bone material along the stress lines would have been to little avail were the material itself not so well adapted to extraordinary pressure. Just like fiberglass made of synthetics threaded with glass fiber, bone tissue is made up of two constituents which greatly differ in their mechanical properties. About half the bone volume is made up of inorganic crystalline material. It consists of phosphate, calcium, and hydroxyl ions and comes very close to hydroxylapatite in structure. It appears in the bone in the form of tiny crystals, only about 200 atomic diameters in size. They are inserted between thin fiber hairs of the elastic material collagen and seem to be linked with them. Many of these parallel inorganic and organic building blocks form fascicles, which may be interwoven in various ways. The end product is a material that is considerably stiffer than collagen, though low in weight, but by far not as brittle and inelastic as pure hydroxylapatite. Besides, because of the continuous alternation between brittle and elastic material, there is little chance for a fracture to spread unchecked.” (Tributsch 1984:32-33)\n",
      "“Mineralized collagen fibrils are highly conserved nanostructural building blocks of bone. By a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and theoretical analysis it is shown that the characteristic nanostructure of mineralized collagen fibrils is vital for its high strength and its ability to sustain large deformation, as is relevant to the physiological role of bone, creating a strong and tough material. An analysis of the molecular mechanisms of protein and mineral phases under large deformation of mineralized collagen fibrils reveals a fibrillar toughening mechanism that leads to a manifold increase of energy dissipation compared to fibrils without mineral phase. This fibrillar toughening mechanism increases the resistance to fracture by forming large local yield regions around crack-like defects, a mechanism that protects the integrity of the entire structure by allowing for localized failure. As a consequence, mineralized collagen fibrils are able to tolerate microcracks of the order of several hundred micrometres in size without causing any macroscopic failure of the tissue, which may be essential to enable bone remodelling. The analysis proves that adding nanoscopic small platelets to collagen fibrils increases their Young’s modulus and yield strength as well as their fracture strength. We find that mineralized collagen fibrils have a Young’s modulus of 6.23 GPa (versus 4.59 GPa for the collagen fibril), yield at a tensile strain of 6.7% (versus 5% for the collagen fibril) and feature a fracture stress of 0.6 GPa (versus 0.3 GPa for the collagen fibril).” (Buehler 2007:1)\n",

      "“For a species to farm bacteria it must facilitate the growth of its epibionts. In a minimalist sense, K. puravida does this by providing an attachment substrate for its bacteria, yet through its continual cheliped movement, K. puravida likely facilitates increased epibiont productivity as well. Chemoautotrophic symbionts require access to oxygen from the water column and reduced compounds, i.e. sulfide or methane, from the seep. During periods of carbon fixation, a boundary layer depleted in one or more of these solutes likely develops, which limits epibiont productivity… We hypothesize that K. puravida waves its chelipeds to shear off boundary layers formed by their epibionts productivity, increasing both the epibionts and, in turn, their own access to food… boundary layers are greatest in areas of reduced flow, such as pits and depressions, which is a habitat where K. puravida commonly occurs, making this behavior even more adaptive. Thus the cheliped waving motion may increase its epibionts chemoautotrophic productivity and yield.” (Thurber et al. 2011:10)\n",

As such, herbivore-induced VOC emissions have been shown to directly deter further attack by herbivorous insects to attract predators or parasitoids of the feeding insect. Furthermore, VOCs released from the attacked plant parts can also serve as airborne phytohormones inducing defense responses in the non-attacked tissues of the same plant or of neighboring plants. Together, there is increasing evidence that induced VOC emissions are an important part of defense strategies against herbivorous insects that plants have evolved owing to their sessile nature.” (Staudt et al., 2010: 1320)\n",

      "“The ballistic projection of the chameleon tongue is an extreme example of quick energy release in the animal kingdom. It relies on a complicated physiological structure and an elaborate balance between tissue elasticity, collagen fibre anisotropy, active muscular contraction, stress release and geometry. A general biophysical model for the dynamics of the chameleon tongue based on large deformation elasticity is proposed. The model involves three distinct coupled subsystems: the energetics of the intralingual sheaths, the mechanics of the activating accelerator muscle and the dynamics of tongue extension. Together, these three systems elucidate the key physical principles of prey-catching among chameleonides.”\n",
      "“To capture prey, chameleons ballistically project their tongues as far as 1.5 body lengths with accelerations of up to 500 m s–2. At the core of a chameleon’s tongue is a cylindrical tongue skeleton surrounded by the accelerator muscle. The key structure in the projection mechanism is probably a cylindrical connective–tissue layer, which surrounds the entoglossal process. … This tissue layer comprises at least 10 sheaths that envelop the entoglossal process. The outer portion connects anteriorly to the accelerator muscle and the inner portion to the retractor structures. The sheaths contain helical arrays of collagen fibres. Prior to projection, the sheaths are longitudinally loaded by the combined radial contraction and hydrostatic lengthening of the accelerator muscle, at an estimated mean power of 144 W kg–1 in C. melleri. Tongue projection is triggered as the accelerator muscle and the loaded portions of the sheaths start to slide over the tip of the entoglossal process. The springs relax radially while pushing off the rounded tip of the entoglossal process, making the elastic energy stored in the helical fibres available for a simultaneous forward acceleration of the tongue pad, accelerator muscle and retractor structures. The energy release continues as the multilayered spring slides over the tip of the smooth and lubricated entoglossal process… Thus, we have identified a unique catapult mechanism that is very different from standard engineering designs.”\n",
      "“[S]mall chameleons are able to project their tongues proportionately longer distances, with projection lengths reaching 2.5 body lengths. Additionally, small chameleon species are shown to be capable of producing peak accelerations during tongue projection of up to 2,590 m s−2, or 264 g and mass-specific power output values during tongue projection of up to 14,040 W kg−1, values that are the highest reported among amniotes. These scaling relationships not only highlight the previously underestimated performance capability of the family, but also the potential utility of taking body size into account when testing for movements harbouring cryptic power amplification mechanisms and how varying metabolic demands may help drive morphological evolution.”\n",
      "“Environmental temperature impacts the physical activity and ecology of ectothermic animals through its effects on muscle contractile physiology. Sprinting, swimming, and jumping performance of ectotherms decreases by at least 33% over a 10 °C drop, accompanied by a similar decline in muscle power. We propose that ballistic movements that are powered by recoil of elastic tissues are less thermally dependent than movements that rely on direct muscular power. We found that an elastically powered movement, ballistic tongue projection in chameleons, maintains high performance over a 20 °C range. Peak velocity and power decline by only 10%–19% with a 10 °C drop, compared to >42% for nonelastic, muscle-powered tongue retraction. These results indicate that the elastic recoil mechanism circumvents the constraints that low temperature imposes on muscle rate properties and thereby reduces the thermal dependence of tongue projection.”\n",

The data presented here demonstrate that the non-cooperative route to attaining breeding status is a viable and widespread strategy, with nearly half of males not serving as betas before becoming alphas (though most alphas have beta partners).” (DuVal 2013:892)\n",

      "“Many dynamical networks, such as the ones that produce the collective behavior of social insects, operate without any central control, instead arising from local interactions among individuals. A well-studied example is the formation of recruitment trails in ant colonies, but many ant species do not use pheromone trails. We present a model of the regulation of foraging by harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) colonies. This species forages for scattered seeds that one ant can retrieve on its own, so there is no need for spatial information such as pheromone trails that lead ants to specific locations. Previous work shows that colony foraging activity, the rate at which ants go out to search individually for seeds, is regulated in response to current food availability throughout the colony’s foraging area. Ants use the rate of brief antennal contacts inside the nest between foragers returning with food and outgoing foragers available to leave the nest on the next foraging trip. Here we present a feedback-based algorithm that captures the main features of data from field experiments in which the rate of returning foragers was manipulated. The algorithm draws on our finding that the distribution of intervals between successive ants returning to the nest is a Poisson process. We fitted the parameter that estimates the effect of each returning forager on the rate at which outgoing foragers leave the nest. We found that correlations between observed rates of returning foragers and simulated rates of outgoing foragers, using our model, were similar to those in the data. Our simple stochastic model shows how the regulation of ant colony foraging can operate without spatial information, describing a process at the level of individual ants that predicts the overall foraging activity of the colony.” (Prabhakar et al. 2012: 1)\n",

The leaves bend upwards and inwards upon cooling and since the rosettes are composed of some 70–200 adult leaves, this movement results in the whole system taking on a globular shape which has been designated a ‘night-bud.’ … The reverse leaf movement takes place upon warming, thus opening the rosette to its day position.The dense layering of the night-bud effectively insulates the inner leaves and especially the core of meristematic leaves from nocturnal frosts.” Beck 1985:83\n",

This so-called night-bud … provides a more or less sealed and insulated air space around the bud-cone during the night, but rapidly opens upon warming by the first rays of sunshine in the morning. Since Beck & al. … have shown that the developing leaves are almost as frost resistant as the adult ones, protection of the leaf-bud from subfreezing temperatures in the night-bud may be interpreted rather as a means to prevent nocturnal stand-still of leaf growth due to freezing than to avoid cryoinjury.” (Beck 1982: 128)\n",

The classic studies of Lindauer showed how bees regulate the hive temperature in hot conditions (Lindauer, 1955). Water is collected by water foragers, then distributed around the hive and in cells containing eggs and larvae; fanning accelerates its evaporation, as does regurgitation and evaporation on the tongue (Lindauer, 1955). Visscher and colleagues measured mean water loads of 44 mg in honeybees collecting water under desert conditions (Visscher et al., 1996). Paper wasps and hornets also use water for cooling their nests, but the highly social stingless bees do not (Jones and Oldroyd, 2007; Roubik, 2006).” (Nicholson 2009:430-431)\n",

Eventually, the lipid contents of the organelles are secreted into the extracellular domain, where they are further processed into compact lipid bilayers that occlude the extracellular spaces among adjacent and overlapping corneocytes (Fig. 4), a condition that has been likened to a ‘bricks-and-mortar’ organization (Elias, 1983; Elias and Menon, 1991). It has been proposed that acylglucosylceramides serve as molecular ‘rivets’ to promote flattening and stacking of lipid vesicles that subsequently fuse edge-to-edge to produce lamellae comprising paired bilayers that are stacked parallel to the skin surface (Engström et al., 2000; Wertz, 2000). These form multiple lamellar sheets with smooth surfaces shown in freeze-fracture studies. In this manner, the extracellular lipids form a continuous domain throughout the stratum corneum and function as the principal barrier to water diffusion (Elias and Friend, 1975; Fig. 2).” (Lillywhite 2006:217)\n",

This surface is completely wettable by nectar secreted at the inner margin of the peristome and by rain water, so that homogenous liquid films cover the surface under humid weather conditions. Only when wet, the peristome surface is slippery for insects, so that most ant visitors become trapped. By measuring friction forces of weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) on the peristome surface of Nepenthes bicalcarata, we demonstrate that the two factors preventing insect attachment to the peristome, i.e., water lubrication and anisotropic surface topography, are effective against different attachment structures of the insect tarsus.” (Bohn and Federle 2004:14138)\n",

      "“We used satellite and ground-based observations to study cloud and leaf wetting patterns in contrasting tropical montane and pre-montane cloud forests. We then studied the consequences of leaf wetting for the direct uptake of water accumulated on leaf surfaces into the leaves themselves. During the dry season, the montane forest experienced higher precipitation, cloud cover and leaf wetting events of longer duration than the pre-montane forest. Leaf wetting events resulted in foliar water uptake in all species studied. The capacity for foliar water uptake differed significantly between the montane and pre-montane forest plant communities, as well as among species within a forest. Our results indicate that foliar water uptake is common in these forest plants and improves plant water status during the dry season.” (Goldsmith et al. 2013:307)\n",

Stomata were mostly sunken or hidden amidst the cuticular elevations. Germination of conidia appeared normal and the germ tubes emerged towards the leaf surface and grew appressed to it. Penetration of hyphae occurred only rarely and the hyphae generally passed over stomata without entering them (Figure 2c). The surface undulations also appeared to mislead the hyphae which produced penetration hyphae over local depressions outside stomatal complexes. Occasionally several stomatopodia were found to have developed in quick succession indicating the complexity of the tropic signals from the highly undulated epidermal surface (Figures 2d, e and f). The hypha frequently passed over stomata without producing stomatopodia over them, but produced stomatopodia immediately after them over some grooves.” (Babu et al. 2003:209)\n",

      "“Where a fluid flows across a surface, such as wind over the earth, the velocity gradient created provides a potential source of work. This gradient might be employed by one burrowing animal to induce air-flow in its long, narrow burrow. The burrow of the black-tailed prairie-dog constitutes a respiratory dead-space of extraordinary magnitude in which diffusion appears inadequate for gas exchange. But the burrow is arranged in a manner appropriate for wind-induced ventilation, typically with two openings at opposite ends and with mounds surrounding these openings of two forms (Fig. 3), with one form on each end. When a breeze crosses the mounds, air enters the burrow through the lower mound and leaves through the higher. The same unidirectional flow is evident with scale models of real mounds on a model burrow in a wind tunnel; flow inside the burrow is nearly a linear function of flow across the mounds (Fig. 4). Wind-induced ventilation in the model burrow could also be induced with model mounds differing in shape but not height. Mounds with sharp rims were more effective exits for air than mounds with rounded tops; in nature such shape differences complement the differences in height.” (Vogel et al. 1973: 1)\n",

Even the queen, who is responsible for reproduction, is replaceable. In the event of queen death, honeybees, for example, can rear emergency queens, and do so very quickly [82]. Decentralization contributes to resilience by ensuring that no individual is irreplaceable; it therefore allows colonies to be resistant to the loss of individuals. Moreover, damage to the system can be dealt with as it happens, without need for time-consuming communications with managers..” (Middleton and Latty 2016: 8)\n",

In addition to their micro- and nanoscale structural regularity, many of these hard tissues form complex hierarchically ordered composites. One such example is found in the siliceous skeletal system of the Western Pacific hexactinellid sponge, Euplectella aspergillum. In this species, the skeleton comprises an elaborate cylindrical lattice-like structure with at least six hierarchical levels spanning the length scale from nanometers to centimeters. The basic building blocks are laminated skeletal elements (spicules) that consist of a central proteinaceous axial filament surrounded by alternating concentric domains of consolidated silica nanoparticles and organic interlayers. Two intersecting grids of non-planar cruciform spicules define a locally quadrate, globally cylindrical skeletal lattice that provides the framework onto which other skeletal constituents are deposited. The grids are supported by bundles of spicules that form vertical, horizontal and diagonally ordered struts.

      "flexibility (the colony can adapt to a changing environment);\n",

      "Business executives relate readily to the first two attributes, but they often balk at the third, which is perhaps the most intriguing. Through self-organization, the behavior of the group emerges from the collective interactions of all the individuals. In fact, a major recurring theme in swarm intelligence (and of complexity science in general) is that even if individuals follow simple rules, the resulting group behavior can be surprisingly complex–and remarkably effective. And, to a large extent, fiexibility and robustness result from self-organization.” (Bonabeau and Meyer 2001:108)\n",
      "“Each insect in a colony seems to have its own agenda, and yet the group as a whole appears to be highly organized. Apparently the seamless integration of all individual activities does not require any supervision. In fact, scientist who study the behavior of social insects have found that cooperation at the colony level is largely self-organized: in numerous situations the coordination arises from interactions among individuals. Although these interactions might be simple (one ant merely following the trail left by another), together they can solve difficult problems (finding the shortest route among countless possible paths to a food source). This collective behavior that emerges from a group of social insects has been dubbed ‘swarm intelligence.'” (Bonebeau and Theraulaz 2008:73-74)\n",
      "“…the ants can select the shortest path to the food source because they lay and follow pheromone (chemical) trails…the colony may occasionally get ‘stuck’ on a longer path if by chance the longer path is the first one marked. In using the ‘trail laying-trail following’ metaphor for optimization purposes, computer scientists found it essential to improve the convergence properties of their algorithms by artificially increasing the rate of pheromone evaporation beyond biological plausibility.” (Bonebeau et al. 2000:39)\n",

Moreover, the solar optical technology includes a complementary strategy: the IR -radiation of body`s heat, between 8000 and 12000 nm, is effectively trapped by an analogue mechanism.” (Khattab and Tributsch 2015:38)\n",

      "“The classic non-transitive system involves a community of three competing species satisfying a relationship similar to the children’s game rock–paper–scissors, where rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. Such relationships have been demonstrated in several natural systems…Colicinogenic [E. coli] bacteria possess a ‘col’ plasmid, containing genes that encode the colicin (the toxin), a colicin-specific immunity protein (which renders the cell immune to the colicin) and a lysis protein (which is expressed when the cell is under stress, causing partial cell lysis [the disintegration of a cell by rupture of the cell wall or membrane]and the subsequent release of the colicin). In general, only a small fraction of a population of colicinogenic cells will lyse and release the colicin. Colicin-sensitive bacteria are killed by the colicin but may occasionally experience mutations that render them resistant to the colicin. The most common mutations alter cell membrane proteins that bind or translocate the colicin. In some cases, the growth rate of resistant cells (R) will exceed that of colicinogenic cells (C), but will be less than the growth rate of sensitive cells (S). This occurs because resistant cells avoid the competitive cost of carrying the col plasmid but suffer because colicin receptor and translocation proteins are also involved in crucial cell functions such as nutrient uptake. In such cases, S can displace R (because S has a growth-rate advantage), R can displace C (because R has a growth-rate advantage) and C can displace S (because C kills S). That is, the C–S–R community satisfies a rock–paper–scissors relationship.” (Kerr et al. 2002:171)\n",

To test whether this is the case, we made in vivo measurements of muscle fiber length change and tendon force in the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and plantaris (PL) muscles of tammar wallabies Macropus eugenii as they hopped at different speeds on a treadmill. Muscle fiber length changes were less than +/-0.5 mm in the plantaris and +/-2.2 mm in the lateral gastrocnemius, representing less than 2 % of total fiber length in the plantaris and less than 6 % in the lateral gastrocnemius, with respect to resting length. The length changes of the plantaris fibers suggest that this occurred by means of elastic extension of attached cross-bridges. Much of the length change in the lateral gastrocnemius fibers occurred at low force early in the stance phase, with generally isometric behavior at higher forces. Fiber length changes did not vary significantly with increased hopping speed in either muscle (P>0.05), despite a 1. 6-fold increase in muscle-tendon force between speeds of 2.5 and 6.0 m s-1. Length changes of the PL fibers were only 7+/-4 % and of the LG fibers 34+/-12 % (mean +/- S.D., N=170) of the stretch calculated for their tendons, resulting in little net work by either muscle (plantaris 0.01+/-0.03 J; gastrocnemius -0.04+/-0.30 J; mean +/- s.d. ). In contrast, elastic strain energy stored in the tendons increased with increasing speed and averaged 20-fold greater than the shortening work performed by the two muscles. These results show that an increasing amount of strain energy stored within the hindlimb tendons is usefully recovered at faster steady hopping speeds, without being dissipated by increased stretch of the muscles’ fibers. This finding supports the view that tendon elastic saving of energy is an important mechanism by which this species is able to hop at faster speeds with little or no increase in metabolic energy expenditure.” (Biewener et al. 1998:1681)\n",

However, microclimatic amelioration due to canopy shading had the strongest effect, which was particularly pronounced in the drier site. Below-ground, shrubs did not modify soil physical characteristics, organic matter, total N and P, or water content, but significantly increased available K, which has been shown to improve seedling water-use efficiency under drought conditions. Conclusions: We propose that in Mediterranean montane ecosystems, characterised by a severe summer drought, pioneer shrubs represent a major safe site for tree early recruitment during secondary succession, improving seedling survival during summer by the modification of both the above- and below-ground environment.” (Gómez-Aparicio et al. 2005:191)\n",

Lower air and soil tempera- tures, radiation and vapor pressure deficit measured below shrub canopies in comparison to open areas re- duced leaf temperature and transpiration losses, conse- quently inducing a more favourable water balance in tree seedlings.” (Gomez-Aparicio et al. 2005:197)\n",

The latter has a powerful stinging response and would be capable of capturing any non-symbiotic fish that entered the tentacles. The presence of clownfish affects the anemone’s behaviour but does not impair its stinging ability, suggesting that a general inhibitory effect mediated by the anemone’s nervous system is not involved. A. clarkii achieves protection from stinging by means of its external mucus layer. This layer appears to be three to four times thicker than that of related fishes that do not inhabit anemones and consists largely of glycoprotein containing neutral polysac­charide. The mucus of A. clarkii remains inert after exposure to extreme denaturing conditions, suggesting that it does not contain specific nematocyte inhibitors or excitatory substances that are masked chemically; its inert nature probably results from a lack of those stimulatory compounds that are present in the mucus of non-symbiotic fishes.” (Lubbock et al. 1980:35)\n",

Across 7 y in a large biodiversity experiment, we show that more diverse plant communities had consistently higher productivity, that is, a higher level of functioning over time. We identify the mechanism for this as turnover in the species driving biomass production; this was substantial, and species that were rare in some years became dominant and drove function in other years. Such high turnover allowed functionally more diverse communities to maintain high biomass over time and was associated with higher levels of complementarity effects in these communities. In contrast, turnover in communities composed of functionally similar species did not promote high biomass production over time.

When only a portion of the area available to bison is burned, intense grazing of burned patches postpones grazing on unburned patches (Figure 4), which results in an accumulation of fuel and an increased probability of fire in unburned patches (Steuter 1986, Hobbs et al. 1991). This interactive model is complicated by the season in which a burn occurs, which influences the effects of fire (Ewing and Engle 1988, Biondini et al. 1989, Howe 1994a) and bison preferences for certain patches (Shaw and Carter 1990, Coppedge and Shaw 1998). Thus, the interaction of these two disturbances—fire and bison grazing patterns—is capable of producing a dynamic patch mosaic of plant communities within grazed grasslands (Steuter et al. 1995, Hamilton 1996).” (Fuhlendorf and Engle 2001:628)\n",

In this system, the ants receive nesting space in the form of swollen stipular thorns, and food from extra-floral nectaries and specialized leaf-tip food bodies (Beltian bodies). The ants in return protect their host plant from herbivores and competing plants, by patrolling aggressively, removing or repelling intruders and clipping competing vegetation…other species of Vachellia do not display the constellation of mutualism-associated traits—inhabitable swollen thorns, food bodies and enlarged extrafloral nectaries—shown by the Mesoamerican ant-acacias.” (Ward and Branstetter 2017:1-2)\n",

The trees also excrete nectar for ant food and have swollen hollow thorns that can be used for nest sites. In return, the ants, which are equipped with powerful stingers, attack caterpillars and deer and any other animals that try to eat the acacia leaves.\n",

Bulls horn acacia trees have large hollow thorns that are occupied by skinny, rust-coloured acacia ants. The trees produce not only nectar but also special oil- and protein-rich nodules on their young leaf tips. These provide all the nutrition the ant colony will ever need. To allow the tree better growing opportunities, the ants even trim away weeds from its base.” (Forsyth 1992:52)\n",

Surface wind, drawing air from the central tunnels of the nest mound, was observed to be the main driving force for nest ventilation during summer. This mechanism of wind-induced ventilation has so far not been described for social insect colonies. Thermal convection, another possible force driving ventilation, contributed very little. According to their predominant airflow direction, two functionally distinct tunnel groups were identified: outflow tunnels in the upper, central region, and inflow tunnels in the lower, peripheral region of the nest mound. The function of the tunnels was independent of wind direction. Outflow of air through the central tunnels was followed by a delayed inflow through the peripheral tunnels.

In response to illumination of the yellow stripe, the difference in potentials between light and darkness increases…The fact that the Oriental hornet correlates its digging activity with insolation, coupled with the ability of its cuticular pigments to absorb part of the solar radiation, may suggest that some form of solar energy harvesting is performed in the cuticle.” (Plotkin et al. 2010:1068)\n",

The xanthopterin pigment found within the cuticle has been proven to be a suitable absorber of light for the harvesting of solar energy by a demonstration of its use in an organic solar cell, with a conversion efficiency of 0.335%.” (Plotkin et al. 2010:1075)\n",

The cuticle is strongly differentiated in terms of relative layer thicknesses and orientation angles along an anterior–posterior gradient. … The altered composite profile of the cuticle in the rostral apex makes the rostrum simultaneously more flexible and fracture resistant, permitting the structure to be repeatedly flexed without exceeding the elastic limits of the cuticle.”\n",
      "“Curculio longinasus Chittenden, 1927 (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a weevil species common throughout the southwestern United States that uses its rostrum—a very slender, curved, beak-like projection of the head—to excavate tunnels in plant organs (such as acorns) for egg laying (oviposition). Once the apical portion of the rostrum has been inserted into the preferred substrate for oviposition, the female begins rotating around the perimeter of the hole, elevating her head by extending the fore-legs, and rotating the head in place in a drilling motion. This action causes signiﬁcant elastic deformation of the rostrum, which will bend until it becomes completely straight.”\n",

      "“Cephalopods have such remarkable camouflage primarily because of their chromatophores – sacs of red, yellow or brown pigment in the skin made visible (or invisible) by muscles around their circumference. These muscles are under the direct control of neurons in the motor centres of the brain, which is why they can blend into the background so quickly. Another aid to camouflage is the changeable texture of cuttlefish skin, which contains papillae – bundles of muscles able to alter the surface of the animal from smooth to spiky. This comes in pretty useful if it needs to hide next to a barnacle-encrusted rock, for instance.\n",
      "“The final part of the cuttlefish’s camouflage portfolio comes from leucophores and iridophores, essentially reflecting plates that sit underneath the chromatophores. Leucophores reflect light across a wide range of wavelengths so can reflect whatever light is available at the time – white light in shallow waters and blue light at depth, for example. Iridophores combine platelets of a protein called reflectin with layers of cytoplasm to produce iridescent reflections rather like those of butterfly wings. Iridophores in other species, like some fish and reptiles, produce optical interference effects that shift the light towards blue and green wavelengths. Cuttlefish can turn these reflectors on or off in seconds to minutes, controlling the spacing of the platelets to select the colour. They can also combine these iridescent hues with those of the chromatophores to make shimmering purples and oranges, for example.” (Brooks 2008:28)\n",

This is puzzling, given the number of naturally salt-tolerant grass species. To better understand why salt-tolerance occurs naturally but is difficult to breed into crop species, we take a novel, biodiversity-based approach to its study, examining the evolutionary lability of salt-tolerance across the grass family. We analyse the phylogenetic distribution of naturally salt-tolerant species on a phylogeny of 2684 grasses, and find that salt-tolerance has evolved over 70 times, in a wide range of grass lineages. These results are confirmed by repeating the analysis at genus level on a phylogeny of over 800 grass genera. While salt-tolerance evolves surprisingly often, we find that its evolution does not often give rise to a large clade of salt-tolerant species. These results suggest that salt-tolerance is an evolutionarily labile trait in grasses” (Bennett 2013:1)\n",

      "“The ability to heal fissures and injuries is characteristic, and an essential feature, of living organisms…A central aim of our research is to analyse fast healing processes in plants quantitatively and to transfer the insights into biomimetic self-repairing technical materials. A cursory pilot study revealed that some lianas, e.g. various Aristolochia species, are especially suitable models as they exhibit very efficient rapid repair mechanisms in their stems (Fig. 2)…A. [Aristolochia] macrophylla reacts to fissures and ruptures in its peripheral strengthening tissues by a rapid repair mechanism which seals the lesions very effectively and secures the functional integrity of the plant structure. As soon as a tiny fissure occurs, parenchyma cells from the surrounding cortex tissue swell into this fissure and immediately start to seal it (Fig. 3A)…Our results indicate that at least four discernable phases might be involved in the fast repair mechanism of the sclerenchyma ring in stems of A. macrophylla: (1) elastic/vasoelastic deformation of the walls of the fissure-sealing parenchyma cells, (2) plastic deformation of the cell walls, (3) cell division in radial and tangential direction, and (4) lignification of the (most peripheral) fissure-sealing cells…[We] suggest that the initial phases of fast repair of fissures take place without cell division and (significant) cell wall biosynthesis but mainly by physico-chemical processes altering the mechanical properties of the cell walls of the fissure-sealing parenchyma cells…This finding is encouraging for attempting to tranfer this repair mechanism into technical applications.

For a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms during the self-repair of lesions in the sclerenchymatous cylinder of the stem, which are caused by internal growth stresses, a classification of morphological changes in the cells involved in the repair process is required. In an early stage of self-repair, we observed morphological changes as a mere extension of the turgescent cortex cells surrounding the lesion, whereby the cell wall extends locally through visco-elastic/plastic deformation without observable cell wall synthesis. Later stages involve typical cell growth and cell division. Several successive phases of self-repair were investigated by light microscopy of stained samples and confocal laser-scanning microscopy in fluorescence mode. The results indicate that A. macrophylla and A. ringens respond to lesions caused by internal growth stresses with a sophisticated self-repair mechanism comprising several phases of different repair modes.” (Busch et al. 2010:2113)\n",

Pollen shoots out and some of it clings to the bee, after which it can be handled in the usual way. The vibrating, caused by the wing muscles, results in bursts of audible sound, hence “buzz-pollination.” A review is by Buchmann (in Jones and Little, 1983).

      "“The ability to climb is a significant advantage for animals, as it makes available habitats not accessible to non-climbers or non-flyers. Indeed, many animal phyla and groups are represented in arboreal habitats. These animals are characterised by mechanisms that facilitate climbing and reduce the risk of falling. On rough surfaces, friction pads and claws can be effective, but on smooth surfaces and significant overhangs, some mechanism of adhesion is essential. Adhesion allows an organism to remain attached to an inclined, vertical or even an upside down surface whilst resisting falling or slipping. Animals have evolved two different mechanisms for adhesion – dry and wet. Dry adhesion, typified by geckos, involves toe pads covered in very large numbers of finely branching setae, each ending in a flattened spatula. These spatulae make such close contact with the surface that van der Waals forces, which hold molecules together in solids, form the adhesive bonds. In contrast, tree frogs adhere by wet adhesion. Mucus, secreted by glands ending on the surface of the toe pads, makes an adhesive bond by a combination of capillarity and viscous forces” (Crawford et al 2012:3965)\n",

Neither the holdfast of a large marine alga nor the byssal thread of an intertidal mussel nor the foot of the wave-challenged snail can be assured of tensile forces perpendicular to its attachment surface. All respond with some tapering disk of attachment that’s increasingly flexible peripherally (fig. 21.1b)–the whole thing distorts a little to avoid stress concentrations at an edge. Thus, a good shape for a glued joint may resemble (and may also function as) a suction cup, even though the two mechanisms are physically distinct.” (Vogel 2003:425)\n",

      "“Despite early reports of high HCO3 and CO3 concentrations in the gut fluid of marine teleosts, intestinal anion exchange was largely overlooked until recently. HCO3 − secretion occurs in the intestine of marine teleosts via Cl−/HCO3 − exchange across the apical membrane and contributes up to 50–70% to Cl−/fluid absorption. It is well documented that marine fish must drink seawater to combat diffusive water loss to a hyperosmotic environment. As imbibed seawater passes through the gut, Na+ and Cl− absorption occurs via Na+:Cl− and Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporters, in addition to apical Cl−/HCO3− exchange. Water follows this salt absorption, leaving behind Mg2+ and SO4 − at concentrations often more than three times those of seawater. In contrast, HCO3 − is present in the gut of marine teleosts at values up to 50 times seawater levels as a result of apical Cl−/HCO3 – exchange within the intestine. Bicarbonate secretion may also play a role in calcium homeostasis, inhibiting intestinal Ca2+ absorption by precipitating CaCO3 which is subsequently excreted. Carbonate precipitation concomitantly promotes water absorption, lowering osmolality by removing Ca2+and CO3 2− from solution.” (Taylor et al. 2006:523)\n",

Protrusion takes only about a thirtieth of a second; acceleration exceeds 100 meters per second squared, or 10 g; and snout speed hits 2.3 meters per second, or over 5 miles per hour.

      "“For Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), huddling is the key to survival during the Antarctic winter. Penguins in a huddle are packed so tightly that individual movements become impossible, reminiscent of a jamming transition in compacted colloids. It is crucial, however, that the huddle structure is continuously reorganized to give each penguin a chance to spend sufficient time inside the huddle, compared with time spent on the periphery. Here we show that Emperor penguins move collectively in a highly coordinated manner to ensure mobility while at the same time keeping the huddle packed. Every 30–60 seconds, all penguins make small steps that travel as a wave through the entire huddle. Over time, these small movements lead to large-scale reorganization of the huddle. Our data show that the dynamics of penguin huddling is governed by intermittency and approach to kinetic arrest in striking analogy with inert non-equilibrium systems, including soft glasses and colloids.” (Zitterbart et al. 2011:e20260)\n",
      "“Social thermoregulation is a cooperative strategy in which animals actively aggregate to benefit from the warmth of conspecifics in response to low ambient temperatures. Emperor penguins, Aptenodytes forsteri, use this behaviour to ensure their survival and reproduction during the Antarctic winter. An emperor penguin colony consists of a dynamic mosaic of compact zones, the so-called huddles, included in a looser network of individuals. To maximize energy savings, birds should adjust their huddling behaviour according to environmental conditions. Here, we examined the dynamics of emperor penguin aggregations, based on photo and video records, in relation to climatic factors. Environmental temperature, wind and solar radiation were the main factors contributing to huddle formation. The analysis of individual movements showed that birds originating from loose aggregations continually joined huddles. Sometimes, a small number of birds induced a movement that propagated to the entire huddle, causing its breakup within 2 min and releasing birds, which then integrated into looser aggregations. Different parts of the colony therefore appeared to continually exchange individuals in response to environmental conditions. A likely explanation is that individuals in need of warmth join huddles, whereas individuals seeking to dissipate heat break huddles apart. The regular growth and decay of huddles operates as pulses through which birds gain, conserve or lose heat. Originally proposed to account for reducing energy expenditure, the concept of social thermoregulation appears to cover a highly dynamic phenomenon that fulfils a genuine regulatory function in emperor penguins.”  (Ancel et al. 2015: 91)\n",

Adventurous gliding motility is powered by the rearward secretion of carbohydrate slime. In both cases, cell movement depends on the translocation of enormous volumes of macromolecules through outer membrane pore complexes…Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for gliding motility including treadmill-like motors on the cell surface and secretion of surfactants that draw the cell forward. Recent experiments support another idea: that the gliding of filamentous bacteria — linked chains of dozens to hundreds of cells — is powered by compressive forces arising from the rearward secretion of slime, a polyelectrolyte gel composed of complex carbohydrates.” (Merz et al. 2002:R297)\n",

      "Common Poorwills, small nocturnal insectivorous birds found across western North America, are seemingly unique because of their alleged ability to remain torpid for extended periods during winter. We used temperaturesensitive radio transmitters to assess patterns of torpor use at sites in the Sonoran desert of southern Arizona. Poorwills used torpor extensively whenever ambient temperature (Ta) dropped below 10° C, and there was little evidence for thermoregulation when Ta was above 5° C. During the winter months (December through February), birds remained entirely inactive on 72% of bird-nights, and continuously inactive periods of 10 days or longer were common. The extent of inactivity is similar behaviorally to that of hibernating small mammals. Roost selection, however, facilitated routine passive solar warming, and inactive birds exhibited a regular pattern of arousal on sunny days, followed by reentry into torpor at sunset. We argue that daily arousals are likely an adaptation to the circumstances that characterize surface dormancy. We hypothesize that the relationship between Ta and availability of flying insects at night, in combination with unique ecological aspects of arid regions, contributed to the evolution of multiday torpor use by poorwills.” (Woods et al. 2004:231)\n",

The hypha grows toward a light source and develops substantial internal pressure by an osmotic mechanism. At maturity, the sporangium gets blown off the top of the hypha, and it goes on its way atop a cylindrical jet of cell sap. Its high drag relative to its mass (being only about 0.3 millimeters in diameter) restricts its range, in practice to about 3 meters.

      "“In this process, secretory vesicles located in the region below the plasma membrane of the oocyte, are fused with the oocyte plasma membrane. This results in the release of contents of the cortical granules, modifying the extracellular matrix so as to be impenetrable to other sperm. The cortical granules contain hydrolytic enzymes, such as proteases that clip perivitelline proteins, peroxidases that harden the vitelline envelope and glycosaminoglycans that attract water into the perivitelline space, causing it to expand and form the hyaline layer. ” (Georgadaki et al. 2016:981)\n",

This touch stimulus initializes outgrowth and cell division of the epidermal cells at the apex of the tips. Originating from these cells, callus-like cell growth leads to the formation of a new tissue type, the pad tissue, within 2–5 wk. Interestingly, the development of such a pad tissue is not limited to the tendril tips. Induced by a touch stimulus, epidermal cells in mature parts of the tendril axes can likewise develop into a pad tissue.” (Bohn et al. 2015:302)\n",
      "“On a flat substrate, fully grown pads possess a hemispherical shape, while on a substrate with cavities, pads grow into these holes, completely filling them with pad tissue and anchoring the tendril in the cavity. In both cases, the pad tissue establishes an optimal form closure with the substrate. In general, the attachment strength of an adhesive pad is determined by the size of the contact interface (apparent contact area) with the substrate and the quality of the form closure (real contact area), i.e., how well the surface of the substrate is structurally mirrored by the pad. Since the adhesive pads of P. discophora grow radially, cavities allow for a larger apparent contact area than a flat substrate for a given pad volume. The quality of the form closure is enhanced by tiny terminal cells of the pad tissue filling up even minute gaps and cavities in the contact zone and by additional secretion of an extracellular substance that fills up remaining micro- and nanogaps and intercellular spaces.” (Bohn et al. 2015:302)\n",

In vertebrates, sodium ion and its counter-ions are the major determinants of the osmolarity of the interstitial fluid (ISF) and blood (Takei 2000). Therefore, changes in Na+ concentration affect both the volume and the flow of water across membranes to maintain osmolarity, and the volume of interstitial fluid.” (Enuka et al. 2012:339)\n",

      "“Motile cilia appear as tufts on the surface of epithelial cells that line body cavities in three organs: oviduct that transfers the ova from the ovary to the uterus, respiratory airways in the lung and brain ventricles (Lyons et al. 2006; Shah et al. 2009). Rhythmic beating of these cilia propels the fluid around the cilia” (Enuka et al. 2012:339)\n",
      "“The volume and the composition of the fluid bathing the cilia are crucial for motile cilia function (Widdicombe 2002; Marshall and Kintner 2008). A major determinant of fluid flow in biological fluids is the relative osmolarity of the extracellular and intracellular liquids (Bourque 2008). In vertebrates, sodium ion and its counter-ions are the major determinants of the osmolarity of the interstitial fluid (ISF) and blood (Takei 2000). Therefore, changes in Na+ concentration affect both the volume and the flow of water across membranes to maintain osmolarity, and the volume of interstitial fluid.” (Enuka et al. 2012:339)\n",
      "“Although the physiological functions of tissues with motile cilia are vastly different, the motile cilia have the same function and that is muco-ciliary transport. To carry out their function, the cilia need to be in a fluid environment, with a tightly regulated volume and fluid depth” (Enuka et al. 2012:352)\n",
      "“As it is well known, 60–70% of the human body weight is water. About 2/3 of this water is within the cells (intracellular fluid, ICF) and the remaining 1/3 fills the extracellular spaces and the vascular bed in the circulatory system (extracellular fluid, ECF) (Ruth and Wassner, 2006). The cell membrane, as a semi-permeable barrier, is permeable to water molecules. Yet, the net movement of water between ECF and ICF depends on the relative osmolarity of these compartments and the permeability of the membranes (Fischbarg, 2010).” (Hanukoglu and Hanukoglu 2016:95)\n",

Thus, it is essential that the parents be aware of the presence of fecal sacs in the nest…The thrasher’s cup-shaped nest is deep, and when defecating, the nestling raises its posterior as high as possible, making the fecal sac readily visible from above. This action was invariably displayed on the flat tabletop in the absence of a nest rim. When the nestling is large enough, it can defecate onto the nest rim, making the fecal sac conspicuous without the parent’s having to observe the defecation. Towards the end of its “nestling” period, the hand-raised thrasher frequently defecated between feedings. Body-shaking did not accompany defecation in the thrasher as it did in the wren.” (Ricklefs 1966:49)\n",

      "Dimethylsulfide (DMS) Iis ubiquitous in the surface waters of the ocean and appears always to be present in concentrations far in excess of the concentrations expected at atmospheric equilibrium. This large concentration gradient between the oceans and the atmosphere drives almost half the biogenic sulfur flux to the earth’s atmosphere. DMS constitutes about 90% of the flux of biogenic sulfur from the ocean to the atmosphere. As a result, considerable attention has been focused on the distribution and dynamics of DMS in ocean water in an effort to understand mechanisms controlling its flux to the atmosphere. The DMS in seawater appears to originate from algae, most likely produced by the decomposition of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a tertiary sulfonium compound analogous to the quaternary ammonium compounds (for example, glycinebetaine and proline) that are widespread in marine organisms. As with these ammonium compounds, DMSP may be involved in regulating cellular osmotic pressure in algae. Decomposition of DMSP appears to occur mainly by an enzymatically catalyzed elimination reaction, yielding DMS and acrylic acid” (Dacey et al. 1986:1314).\n",
      "“Petrels, albatrosses and other procellariiform seabirds have an excellent sense of smell, and routinely navigate over the world’s oceans by mechanisms that are not well understood. These birds travel thousands of kilometres to forage on ephemeral prey patches at variable locations, yet they can quickly and efficiently find their way back to their nests on remote islands to provision chicks, even with magnetic senses experimentally disrupted. Over the seemingly featureless ocean environment, local emissions of scents released by phytoplankton reflect bathymetric features such as shelf breaks and seamounts. These features suggest an odour landscape that may provide birds with orientation cues. We have previously shown that concentrated experimental deployments of one such compound, dimethyl sulphide (DMS), attracts procellariiforms at sea, suggesting that some species can use it as a foraging cue. Here we present the first physiological demonstration that an Antarctic seabird can detect DMS at biogenic levels. We further show that birds can use DMS as an orientation cue in a non-foraging context within a concentration range that they might naturally encounter over the ocean” (Nevitt et al. 2005:303)\n",

      "“…although probiotic lactobacilli protect against a number of infections, the exact mechanisms responsible for this activity are not entirely clear. However, we recently showed that the RC-14 BSF [biosurfactant] contains a number of collagen-binding (Cnb) proteins [10] including a 29-kDa Cnb (p29Cnb) that can inhibit the adhesion of Enterococcus faecalis 1131 in vitro [5]. Given that S. aureus often initiates host binding via cell surface extracellular matrix-binding proteins (ECMBPs) [11], it seems reasonable to suggest that ECMBPs present within RC-14 BSF may effectively compete with S. aureus ECMBPs for binding to host sites. This could explain, in part, the competitive exclusion mechanism of probiotic lactobacilli [12] in colonizing and protecting the urogenital and gastrointestinal tract from infections. Although this notion is consistent with bacterial adhesion being a critical step in the development of most S. aureus infections [11], other factors produced by RC-14 may account in large part for the observed antistaphylococcal activity.” (Gan et al. 2002:1372)\n",

Their embryos ride out seasonal droughts buried in mud, where microbial action often uses up all the oxygen. Jason Podrabsky, a comparative physiologist at Portland State University in Oregon, and his colleagues tested killifish embryos by sealing them in oxygen-free vials. After 62 days, half the embryos recovered when given oxygen (The Journal of Experimental Biology, vol 210, p 2253). The next best vertebrates – turtles and a species of goldfish – can survive for only a few days. Podrabsky found that longer-lived killifish embryos accumulated lactate – the end product of anaerobic metabolism – very slowly, suggesting that their anaerobic ability comes from being able to cut their metabolic rate to extremely low levels. Podrabsky is now studying which genes are responsible for the metabolic slowing. Learning how the fish do this may help explain how human tissues respond to anoxia during, say, a heart attack, Podrabsky says.” (New Scientist 2007:1)\n",

      "In one species of lobelia that grows on the upper slopes of Mount Kenya, “Its rosette forms a deep watertight cup that contains up to three quarters of a gallon of liquid. Each night, a plate of ice forms across the surface. This acts as a shield, preventing the frost from penetrating more deeply into the pond. The water beneath remains liquid and therefore above freezing point and the submerged bud survives undamaged. It is a minimal defence. Were the nights to last a few hours longer or the temperature to stay below zero during the day, then the contents of the ponds might freeze solid right to the bottom and the bud would be killed. As it is, however, the sun returns after a few hours and all is well…But now the lobelia faces a different hazard. If the sun shines so hotly during the day that the water in the pond evaporates, then the lobelia would be defenceless when night fell. However, this does not happen. The fluid in the pond is not rain water. Indeed it cannot be for very little rain falls on these slopes. The plant has secreted it from special glands and it contains a slime that inhibits evaporation. So even during the hottest afternoons, its defence does not vanish.” (Attenborough 1995:263)\n",

Experiments reported here show that rosettes drained of this liquid experienced bud temperatures well below freezing, whereas control rosettes never experienced bud temperatures below freezing. The presence of the reservoir did not affect the rate of leaf warming in the morning. The mucilaginous substance was identified as a pectin, which probably reduces evaporation from the reservoir without lowering the freezing temperature of the water.” (Young and Van Orden Robe 1986:267)\n",

Among the cyanophages, podoviruses and siphoviruses tend to be very host-specific, whereas myoviruses generally have a broader host range, even across genera [5], and thus are potential vectors for horizontal gene transfer via transduction. The movement of genes between organisms is an important mechanism in evolution. As agents of gene transfer, phages play a role in host evolution by supplying the host with new genetic material [11–15] and by displacing ‘host’ genes with viral-encoded homologues [16–18]…Because maximal cyanophage production is dependent on photosynthesis [31,33], and the host PsbA protein turns over rapidly [34] and declines during infection [31], expression of these phage-encoded genes likely enhances photosynthesis during infection, thus increasing cyanophage fitness.” (Sullivan et al. 2006:1344-1345)\n",

However, the exact contribution of EBCs to salt tolerance in the ice plant remains poorly understood. An M. crystallinum mutant lacking EBCs was isolated from plant collections mutagenized by fast neutron irradiation. Light and electron microscopy revealed that mutant plants lacked EBCs on all surfaces of leaves and stems…The EBC mutant also showed reduced leaf succulence and leaf and stem water contents compared with wild-type plants. Aerial tissues of wild-type plants had approximately 1.5-fold higher Na+ and Cl– content than the mutant grown under 400 mM NaCl for 2 weeks. Na+ and Cl– partitioning into EBCs of wild-type plants resulted in lower concentrations of these ions in photosynthetically active leaf tissues than in leaves of the EBC-less mutant, particularly under conditions of high salt stress…The EBC mutant showed significant impairment in plant productivity under salt stress as evaluated by seed pod and seed number and average seed weight.

Peak power output likely implies elastic recoil of the complex aponeurotic system of the vastus muscle…It is argued here that the multiple internal connective tissue sheets and attachment structures of the well–developed bundles of the vastus muscle become increasingly stretched during preparatory crouching and throughout the extension phase, except for the last 13 ms of the push–off (i.e. when power requirements peak).

The structural details of the attachment process are not yet entirely understood. We studied the attachment process of English ivy in detail and suggest a four-phase process to describe the attachment strategy: (i) initial physical contact, (ii) form closure of the root with the substrate, (iii) chemical adhesion [glue], and (iv) shape changes of the root hairs and form-closure with the substrate [root hairs dry and scrunch into a spiral shape that locks them into place]. These four phases and their variations play an important role in the attachment to differently structured surfaces. We demonstrate that, in English ivy, different mechanisms work together to allow the plant’s attachment to various climbing substrates and reveal the importance of micro-fibril orientation in the root hairs for the attachment based on structural changes at the subcellular level.” (Melzer et al. 2010:1383)\n",

Charged ions are retained in the velamen probably due to positive and negative charges in the cell walls, while uncharged compounds are lost to the external medium. Finally, we demonstrate that nutrient uptake follows biphasic kinetics with a highly efficient, active transport system at low external concentrations.

The capsule halves spring outward, which not only releases the seeds within, but expels them explosively at speeds up to 12 meters per second (27 miles per hour); they travel up to about 3 meters.

The failure of the seam joining the two values precipitates the conversion of the elastic potential energy stored in the valves and seeds.

      "“The shape of the carapace protecting the body of boxfishes has been attributed an important hydrodynamic role in drag reduction and in providing automatic, flow-direction realignment and is therefore used in bioinspired design of cars. However, tight swimming-course stabilization is paradoxical given the frequent, high-performance manoeuvring that boxfishes display in their spatially complex, coral reef territories. Here, by performing flow-tank measurements of hydrodynamic drag and yaw moments together with computational fluid dynamics simulations, we reverse several assumptions about the hydrodynamic role of the boxfish carapace. Firstly, despite serving as a model system in aerodynamic design, drag-reduction performance was relatively low compared with more generalized fish morphologies. Secondly, the current theory of course stabilization owing to flow over the boxfish carapace was rejected, as destabilizing moments were found consistently. This solves the boxfish swimming paradox: destabilizing moments enhance manoeuvrability, which is in accordance with the ecological demands for efficient turning and tilting.” (Van Wassenbergh et al. 2015:20141146)\n",
      "“The role of body-shape working with recoil-forces generated by propulsors is also well illustrated for fishes with rigid tests, such as boxfishes. The keels on the body create vortices that oppose yawing and pitching displacements (Bartolet al. 2003, 2008; Van Wassenbergh et al. 2015). Bartol et al. (2002, 2003) measured forces and moments in a water tunnel on whole bodies including tails of several species of boxfishes and trunkfishes and propose these contribute to stability (Bartol et al. 2008). Van Wassenbergh et al. (2015) disagree, based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and measurements on carapaces, claiming vortex-related forces are too small to be a significant factor in stabilization. The two studies used multiple but different methods that could affect the results and hence conclusions. Differences in methods include: CFD and particle image velocimetry (PIV), pressure measurement, source materials and verification in making boxfish models, inclusion of the tail, location of the CM, and sting location and shape suspending models in flows. Clearly additional work is necessary to understand the apparent conflicts between these studies.” (Webb and Weihs 2015:761)\n",

Temporal countercurrent heat exchange in the nasal passage reduces expired air temperature (Te) below body temperature (Tb). At a mean ambient temperature of 13.7 degrees C, Te is 20.9 degrees C. This results in the recovery of 71.5% of the water added to inspired air. The amount of cooling of the expired air (Tb – Te) and the percentage of water recovery varies inversely with ambient temperature. Total nasal surface area available for heat and water exchange, located in the highly convoluted nasal turbinates, is estimated to be 720 cm² in weaned pups and 3140 cm² in an adult male. Nasal temporal countercurrent heat exchange reduces total water loss sufficiently to allow maintenance of water balance using metabolic water production alone.” (Huntley et al. 1984:447)\n",

Our research indicates that this unique property is attributed to the smart design of elaborate micro- and nanostructures: hexagonally non-close-packed (ncp) nipples at the nanoscale prevent microscale fog drops from condensing on the ommatidia surface, and hexagonally close-packed (hcp) ommatidia at the microscale could efficiently prevent fog drops from being trapped in the voids between the ommatidia.” (Gao et al. 2007:2213)\n",

Moreover, the loose arrangement of nanonipples on hcp microhemispheres makes an extremely discrete and nonplanar triple-phase (liquid-air-solid) contact line, which is energetically favorable for driving the spherical fog drops effortlessly from the surface.” (Gao et al. 2007:2214)\n",

A drop striking a non-wetting surface of this type will spread out to a maximum diameter11,12,13,14 and then recoil to such an extent that it completely rebounds and leaves the solid material15,16,17,18. The amount of time that the drop is in contact with the solid—the ‘contact time’—depends on the inertia and capillarity of the drop1, internal dissipation19 and surface–liquid interactions20,21,22. And because contact time controls the extent to which mass, momentum and energy are exchanged between drop and surface23, it is often advantageous to minimize it. The conventional approach has been to minimize surface–liquid interactions that can lead to contact line pinning20,21,22; but even in the absence of any surface interactions, drop hydrodynamics imposes a minimum contact time that was conventionally assumed to be attained with axisymmetrically spreading and recoiling drops21,24. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the contact time below this theoretical limit by using superhydrophobic surfaces with a morphology that redistributes the liquid mass and thereby alters the drop hydrodynamics.” (Bird et al. 2013:385)\n",

Water landing on the leaf margins beads up in a near-superhydrophobic fashion (contact angle greater than 140°); whilst in the middle (including the midrib), the water spreads due to the hydrophilic nature of the surface (contact angle less than 90°), Table 1. These contrasting wettabilities are most noticeable in the movement of water across the leaf surface. Once large enough, droplets of water on the margin of the leaf roll towards the middle, assisted by the low contact angle hysteresis inherent to the margin, Table 1, and the slight gradient downwards due to the concave shape of the leaf, Fig. 1(a). Pools of water collecting in the middle eventually coalesce over time, forming a downward stream-like film of water, Fig. 1(b–c). As the stream increases in volume, the water flow begins to move towards the leaf tip, assisted by the hanging gradient present between the petiole and the apex of the leaf. Eventually, the droplet formed at the apex falls to the ground.” (Wigzell et al. 2016: 346)\n",

      "“Arguably the most comprehensively studied group of surfactant and surface-active proteins is the fungal hydrophobins. First discovered in Schizophyllum commune, they have subsequently been found to be ubiquitous among ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. These fungi typically live in moist environments and erect aerial hyphae to spread. Under such conditions, surface tension at the air–water interface constitutes a significant barrier to hyphal erection. To overcome this barrier, the submerged hyphal cells secrete hydrophobins into the surrounding environment. The proteins assemble at the air–water interface, resulting in a significant decrease of the interfacial tension, which is essential for the hyphae to break through the surface. Moreover, they form a hydrophobic coating on the aerial hyphae, fruiting bodies, and spores. This coating not only allows the hyphae to colonize hydrophobic materials; it also facilitates dispersal of the spores into the air, promotes attachment to hydrophobic surfaces aiding invasion of hosts, and protects the spores of pathogenic fungi (e.g., Aspergillus sp.) from the host’s immune system” (Schor et al. 2016:610)\n",

The resulting vacuolar Na+ sequestration protects essential enzymatic reactions in the cytoplasm from excess Na+ levels while maintaining turgor (Glenn et al., 1999).” (Horie and Schroeder 2004: 2457)\n",
      "“Vacuolar sequestration of Na+ is an important and cost-effective strategy for osmotic adjustment that also reduces the Na+ concentration in the cytosol. Na+ sequestration into the vacuole depends on expression and activity of Na+/H+ antiporters as well as V-type H+– ATPase and H+– PPase. These phosphatases generate the necessary proton gradient required for activity of Na+/H+ antiporters. Salt accumulation in mangroves occurs with the sequestration of Na+ and Cl– into the vacuoles of the hypodermal storage tissue of the leaves (Werner and Stelzer 1990; Aziz and Khan 2001a; Kura-Hotta et al. 2001; Mimura et al. 2003).” (Parida 2010: 203)\n",

      "“Through anatomical measurements, we find that 22 species of mammals possess eyelashes of a length one-third the eye width. Wind tunnel experiments confirm that this optimal eyelash length reduces both deposition of airborne particles and evaporation of the tear film by a factor of two. Using scaling theory, we find this optimum arises because of the incoming flow’s interactions with both the eye and eyelashes. Short eyelashes create a stagnation zone above the ocular surface that thickens the boundary layer, causing shear stress to decrease with increasing eyelash length. Long eyelashes channel flow towards the ocular surface, causing shear stress to increase with increasing eyelash length. These competing effects result in a minimum shear stress for intermediate eyelash lengths.” (Amador et al. 2015:1)\n",
      "“For short lashes, the boundary layer at the eye surface is thickened because of the flow resistance imposed by the lashes and so the shear stress approximately scales as τ∼L−1. Long eyelashes protrude further into the surrounding airflow and channel high-velocity airflow towards the eye; therefore, the shear stress scales as τ∼L2. The competition between these two effects results in an intermediate optimal eyelash length L/W=0.3±0.1, where W is the eye’s opening width. At this length, eyelashes reduce particle deposition by 50%.” (Amador and Hu 2015:3171)\n",

      "“In still or slowly-moving waters there is one easy way to collect [light]: a plant can float its leaves upon the surface. No plant does this on a more spectacular scale or more aggressively than the giant Amazon water-lily. A leaf first appears on the surface as a huge fat bud, studded with spines. Within a few hours, it bursts open and starts to spread. Its margin has an up-turned rim, six inches high, so that as it expands it is able to shoulder aside any other floating leaf that gets in its way. Beneath, it is strengthened with girder-like ribs which make the whole structure rigid. They also contain air-spaces within them that keep it afloat. Expanding at the rate of half a square yard in a single day, the leaf grows until it is six feet across. The underside of the leaf is a rich purple colour and armoured with abundant sharp spikes, perhaps as a defence against leaf-eating fish. One plant can produce forty or fifty of such leaves in a single growing season and monopolise the surface so effectively that few plants of other kinds can grow alongside or below it…In 1847, viable seeds did arrive at Kew and there the gardeners managed to get them to germinate. One of the seedlings was sent to Joseph Paxton who was in charge of the Duke of Devonshire’s splendid gardens at Chatsworth…Paxton was not only a gardener of great skill but an architect of near-genius. He built one of the first big glass-houses. When he came to design the cast-iron supports for his hitherto unprecedented expanse of glass, he remembered the ribs and struts of his giant water-lily that supported the gigantic leaves and used them as the basis of his designs not only for the glass-houses at Chatsworth but also, a few years later, for his architectural masterpiece, the Crystal Palace in London.” (Attenborough 1995:290)\n",

As in normal serpentine movement, the snake propagates waves of bending rearward. But it doesn’t slide along a serpentine path that traces the line of contact of those curves with the ground. Instead, it alternately fixes part of the body to the ground, pushing sideways against the sand, and lifts the adjacent part. So a given location of the snake never slides but repeatedly lifts and sets down. The process leaves a set of indentations in the sand at right angles to the snake’s progress. In this way the snake never has to push against anything but a broad expanse of substratum–a good tactic since a sandy substratum doesn’t resist being pushed upon at all well.” (Vogel 2003:489)\n",

      "“instead of being lens cylinders with high refractive indices and a radial gradient, the [optical structures of shrimps and their relatives] were square structures of low refractive index, made of more or less homogeneous jelly…[Klaus Vogt in 1975] found that the jelly blobs were silvered, and they were not lenses at all, but mirror boxes (Fig. 8.13b)…it now appears that this reflecting system is the rule throughout the long-bodies [sic] decopod crustaceans–the shrimps, prawns, lobsters, crayfish, and the anomuran squat lobsters…In essence the reflecting superposition mechanism is extremely simple. In 1975 Vogt wrote: ‘Rays from an object point entering through different facets are superimposed not by refracting systems as in other superposition eyes, but by a radial arrangement of orthogonal reflecting planes which are formed by the sides of the crystalline cones and the purine layers surrounding them.’ As Fig. 8.14 shows, the mirrors direct light to a common focus. Mirrors are inverters, just like the telescopes in refracting superposition eyes (Fig. 8.3b), and so the ray-bending that the two kinds of optical element perform is almost identical. However, problems start to arise when one tries to work out what will happen to rays that are not in the idealized central plane shown in Fig. 8.14b. In general, rays in oblique planes will not encounter just one side of each mirror box, but two. What happens to such rays? Do they, like the singly reflected rays in Fig. 8.14, all reach a common focus?\n",
      "“It turns out that the square arrangement of the facet array (almost unique to the decapod crustaceans) is crucial here. The principle is that of the ‘corner reflector’ [like those mirrors found in corners of stores]…A ray reflected from the two mirrors must be rotated through a total of two right angles, which means that it will return parallel to its original direction, no matter what angle the ray initially makes with the mirror pair. In other words, apart from a slight lateral displacement of the reflected ray, a corner mirror behaves as though it were a single mirror, but one that is always at right angles to the incoming ray. This property turns out to be very useful, for example in radar reflectors for ships and buoys, and it is also the property that makes reflecting superposition possible…\n",
      "“Various other features of these eyes are important for their function. The mirror boxes must be the right depth, two to three times the width, so that most rays are reflected from two of the faces, but not more. Rays that pass straight through are intercepted by the unsilvered ‘tail’ of the mirror boxes, and Vogt (1980) showed that its refractive index decreases in such a way that appropriate critical angle reflexion continues to occur through the clear zone. Finally, there is the weak lens in the cornea of the crayfish. This lens ‘pre-focuses’ the light that enters the mirror box, thus given a narrower beam at the retina. All these features provide an image generally comparable in quality to that produced by refracting superposition optics (Bryceson and McIntyre), although it does seem that rays which make too many or too few reflections contribute to measurable stray light (glare) in the image of on the retina.” (Land and Nilsson 2002:172-174)\n",

Both species are exposed to waves with peak velocities between 1 and 6. m sec-1, and experience drag forces of the order of 0.2-20 N. Form drag is minimized on these flexible plants which are bent over parallel to the flow; however, about five times the force is required to bend a Lessonia stipe a given amount than a Durvillea stipe. Lessonia are stiffer (mean E = 22.0 MN. m -2) and stronger (mean breaking σ = 1.2 MN. m-2) than Durvillea (mean E = 3.5 MN. m-2 ; mean breaking σ = 0.7 MN. m-2), but Durvillea extend more before breaking (mean breaking ε = 0.17) than Lessonia (mean breaking ε = 0.09); hence the work that waves must perform to break either species is essentially the same (4 KJ . m-2 in 5.4 cm long specimens). In nature, both species tend to fail at flaws produced by grazing animals.

The structure of a Toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) beak was found to be a sandwich composite with an exterior of keratin and a fibrous network of closed cells made of calcium-rich proteins. The keratin layer is comprised of superposed hexagonal scales (50 µm diameter and 1 µm thickness) glued together. Its tensile strength is about 50 MPa and Young’s modulus is 1.4 GPa. Micro and nanoindentation hardness measurements corroborate these values. The keratin shell exhibits a strain-rate sensitivity with a transition from slippage of the scales due to release of the organic glue, at a low strain rate (5 · 10-5/s) to fracture of the scales at a higher strain rate (1.5 · 10-3/s). The closed-cell foam is comprised of fibers having a Young’s modulus twice as high as the keratin shells due to their higher calcium content. The compressive response of the foam was modeled by the Gibson–Ashby constitutive equations for open and closed-cell foam. There is a synergistic effect between foam and shell evidenced by experiments and analysis establishing the separate responses of shell, foam, and foam + shell. The stability analysis developed by Karam and Gibson, assuming an idealized circular cross section, was applied to the beak. It shows that the foam stabilizes the deformation of the beak by providing an elastic foundation which increases its Brazier and buckling load under flexure loading.” (Seki et al. 2005:5281)\n",

The three features together – the reduction of the primary vortex separation, the gap between the vibrissa and the first vortices and the symmetry of the pressure field – prevent large periodic forces on the vibrissa originating from its own wake and thus prevent vortex-induced vibrations.” (Hanke et al. 2010:2669)\n",
      "“The structure of the harbor seal vibrissa demonstrates a highly efficient mechanism for the suppression of forces owing to vortex shedding from rod-like objects with drag reduction. Numerous applications in biomimetic designs are conceivable, including flow sensors for underwater vehicles or parts of buildings and offshore facilities with reduced vibrations from wind or water flow. Inspiration from nature has so far been lacking in this field of research. Particularly challenging is the suppression of vortex induced vibrations in flexible structures with low mass (Owen et al., 2001), as observed here.” (Hanke et al. 2010:2671)\n",

Canopy plasticity, the expression of different leaf phenotypes within the crown of an individual tree has complex functional and evolutionary implications that remain to be thoroughly assessed. We hypothesized that it can lead to disparity in how leaves in different positions of the canopy change with allometric growth and population genetic structure.\n",
      "2. Leaf phenotypes of the inner and outer canopy were estimated using eight morphological and physiological characters…With these data, we investigated the extent to which leaf phenotypes change with plant size, genetic processes and in = response to environmental conditions inside and outside the canopy.\n",
      "3. The size of trees measured in the field was clearly associated with the phenotype of sun [leaves] but not to that of shade leaves. The phenotype of sun leaves depended on both direct and diffuse light, while that of shade leaves was found to correlate only with diffuse radiation. Additionally, light availability inside the canopy was conditioned by the shape of external leaves, and increasing elongation of sun leaves led to higher radiation in the inner canopy.\n",
      "4. The field phenotypes of both inner and outer canopy leaves were correlated with genetic variation among populations. Conversely, in the common garden, the different genotypes expressed a homogeneous sun phenotype, while phenotypic differences among populations remained apparent in shade leaves.\n",
      "5. We conclude that, in agreement with our working hypothesis, canopy plasticity is both cause and consequence of the environment experienced by the plant and might lead to the differential expression of genetic polymorphisms among leaves. Furthermore, we propose that it can contribute to buffer abiotic stress and to the partition of light use within the tree crown.” (de Casas et al. 2011:802)\n",

These include biofilm-forming bacteria along with single-cell diatoms that rapidly settle, attach and form colonies on any surface placed in the marine environment. The formation of a microbial biofilm promotes the attachment of algal spores, protozoa, barnacle cyprids and marine fungi, followed by the settlement of other marine invertebrate larvae and macro- algae…Heavy surface fouling could lead to the accumulation of toxic wastes, a reduction in oxygen and nutrient availability and increased drag, which can cause sessile organisms to become dislodged from benthic substrata in strong currents…egg capsules appear to be highly resilient multilaminate biomaterials…egg capsules can remain in the marine environment for several months, and thus would also be vulnerable to surface fouling. Nevertheless, previous studies indicate that these egg capsules remain axenic and remarkably free of surface macrofouling…surface composition and microtexture can influence the rate of biofouling…homogeneous surfaces are capable of deterring attachment by limiting space available for fouling organisms…egg capsules of neogastropods, including D. orbita, were significantly less fouled than a range of gelatinous egg masses.” (Lim et al. 2007:276)\n",

This layer has regular homogeneous ridges separated by 1 to 5 μm…during the third week, densities of these bacteria increased and other fouling organisms such as filamentous algae were observed, forming a mixed biofilm community. In the later stages of development (>4 wk old veligers), the fouled outer wall structure began to dissociate and shed from the capsule, leaving behind a naked capsule without any texture…Unidentified droplets ranging from 8 to 20 μm appeared on the surface of mature egg capsules after the majority of the outer wall dissociated. These droplets were either solitary or clumped in association with attached bacteria.” (Lim et al. 2007:279)\n",

In this time, large amounts of fat are burned as fuel to raise the body temperature. This is accompanied by intense shivering and muscle contraction, which also generate heat. Much of the heat is derived from oxidation of brown fat, a kind of fat that contains many energy-producing cells. As much as 57 percent of the brown fat in ground squirrels is around their shoulders, with 14 percent in their neck, and most of the remainder in their thorax. This substance acts like an electric blanket, releasing heat to the heart and major blood vessels to warm them and speed the circulation of oxygen to the brain and other anterior organs, and then to the posterior body regions. During arousal, the anterior skeletal muscles receive over 16 times more blood than their counterparts in a fully awake animal, powering their shivering to produce heat for raising the body’s temperature.” (Shuker 2001:101)\n",

Its floating leaves are evenly covered with complex hydrophobic hairs retaining a layer of air when submerged under water. Surprisingly the terminal cells of the hairs are hydrophilic. These hydrophilic patches stabilize the air layer by pinning the air-water interface. This ‘Salvinia Effect’ provides an innovative concept to develop biomimetic surfaces with long-term air-retention capabilities for under water applications.” (Barthlott et al. 2010: 2325)\n",
      "“To demonstrate the pinning effect, individual eggbeater hairs were dipped into water. From a lateral view the shape and size of the water meniscus created, when pulling the hairs out of the water was recorded…As a measure of the hydrophilicity we took the distance between the tip of the hairs and the water surface at the exact instant when the meniscus snapped off. This experiment was done with untreated hairs and hairs that were rendered hydrophobic by dipping them into a Teflon (polytetra-?uoroethylene, PTFE) solution. The water meniscus could be pulled roughly twice as high by the untreated hair…than by the Teflon coated hair…The function of the eggbeater hairs is obvious – they allow the trapping of a thin air layer reaching from the surface of the plant leaf to the top of the hairs. Penetration of water into this well-defined region requires energy for creating an increased contact area between the water and the hydrophobic hairs.\n",

At these extreme temperatures, most insects are bugsicles. The Alaskan Upis beetle, for example, freezes at around minus 19 degrees. But, remarkably, it can survive exposure to temperatures as low as about minus 100 degrees…a new kind of antifreeze was recently discovered in the Upis beetle by a team of researchers from the University of Notre Dame and the University of Alaska-Fairbanks.

This study shows that a (lipo)xylomannan isolated from U. ceramboides is a highly active THF that is structurally distinct from all known AFPs and antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGPs) reported to date. In contrast to known AFGPs, which comprise ~39% peptide by mass, THFs isolated from U. ceramboides contain little to no protein. In addition, the β-Manp-(1->4) β-Xylp backbone is unrelated to the saccharide component of fish AFGPs…This xylomannan antifreeze may contribute to freeze tolerance by preventing recrystallization of extracellular ice, preventing intracellular freezing and/or stabilizing cellular membranes at low temperature.” (Walters et al. 2009:20214).\n",

So secretion of gas from blood into swimbladder faces a big barrier, and swimbladder gas will all too readily go into solution in the fish’s blood and thence out into the ocean. Two devices stand in the way. First, a layer in the swimbladder wall provides a very effective barrier to the passage of oxygen (Lapennas and Schmidt-Nielsen 1977). Second, blood leaving the so-called gas gland in the wall of the swimbladder passes through an exchanger (fig.5.2) in which blood leaving the swimbladder loses excess dissolved gas specifically to blood moving toward the swimbladder (Scholander 1954).” (Vogel 2003:99-100)\n",

So if a fish with a gas-filled swimbladder is to remain neutrally buoyant at different depths, it must secrete or absorb gas to keep the swimbladder at constant volume as the ambient pressure changes. To regulate the mass of gas within the swimbladder in this way requires complex mechanisms of great physiological interest.” (Bone et al. 1995:79-80)\n",

The build-up of complexity in communities is theoretically difficult, because in random-pattern models complexity leads to instability1. There is growing evidence, however, that nonrandom patterns in the strengths of the interactions between predators and prey strongly enhance system stability2, 3, 4. Here we show how such patterns explain stability in naturally assembling communities. We present two series of below-ground food webs along natural productivity gradients in vegetation successions5, 6. The complexity of the food webs increased along the gradients. The stability of the food webs was captured by measuring the weight of feedback loops7 of three interacting ‘species’ locked in omnivory. Low predator–prey biomass ratios in these omnivorous loops were shown to have a crucial role in preserving stability as productivity and complexity increased during succession. Our results show the build-up of food-web complexity in natural productivity gradients and pin down the feedback loops that govern the stability of whole webs. They show that it is the heaviest three-link feedback loop in a network of predator–prey effects that limits its stability. Because the weight of these feedback loops is kept relatively low by the biomass build-up in the successional process, complexity does not lead to instability.” (Neutel et al. 2007:599)\n",

The C in the oxalates forms from atmospheric CO2 (Catm) via a series of complex biochemical pathways…A large [Carnegiea] gigantea contains on the order of 1×105 g of the Ca oxalate weddellite—CaC2O4·2H2O.

      "“The rare plant Rheum palaestinum (Polygonaceae) is a perennial hemicryptophyte that grows during the rainy winter in desert mountainous areas in Israel and Jordan that receive an average annual rainfall of ca. 75 mm. It produces between one and four large round leaves that are tightly attached to the ground and form large rosettes of up to 1 m2. These leaves differ markedly from the typical small leaves of most desert plants. Moreover, they have a unique 3D morphology resembling a scaled-down mountainous area with well-developed steep drainage systems, raising the question which selective agents were involved in their evolution. We propose that the large leaves collect rainwater that then infiltrates the soil surrounding the root. We measured the seasonal course of leaf growth, examined the area of wet soil surrounding the root after actual and simulated rain, and modeled the water harvesting capacity using the plant leaf area and the weekly precipitation. We show that even in the slightest rains, water flows above the veins to the leaf’s base where it irrigates the vertical root. A typical plant harvests more than 4,100 cm3 of water per year, and enjoys a water regime of about 427 mm/year, equivalent to the water supply in a Mediterranean climate. This is the first example of self-irrigation by large leaves in a desert plant, creating a leaf-made mini oasis.” (Lev-Yadun et al. 2009:393)\n",

These high rates are due to slower decomposition rates under anaerobic conditions and cooler temperatures in boreal and arctic regions where most wetlands are found (Fig. 1.8). As a consequence, today wetlands may contain as much as 40% of global soil carbon, most of it in peatlands and forested wetlands. Although they cover only 3% of the world’s land area, peatlands alone may contain as much as 25% of the soil carbon pool. So much carbon is stored in northern peatlands that changes in the amount of carbon stored in peatlands have been hypothesized to be linked to global ice-age cycles (Frazen 1994). Although wetlands are an important sink for carbon, they are not expected to sequester much additional carbon as global CO2 levels increase. In other words, wetlands are not expected to ameliorate global climate change. In fact, the opposite is predicted.” (van der Valk 2006:142-143)\n",

      "“Our results provide empirical evidence that, compared with solo flight, formation flight confers a significant aerodynamic advantage which allows birds [great white pelicans, Pelecanus onocrotalus] to reduce their energy expenditure while flying at a similar speed. In birds flying in formation, each wing moves in an upwash field that is generated by the wings of the other birds in the formation. Modelling has shown that when birds are flying with optimal spacing, a maximal reduction in power can be achieved and total transport costs can be substantially reduced. However, field observations of V formations indicate that birds often shift from their optimal positioning, perhaps in an attempt to maximize the aerodynamic advantage of flight formation, thus reducing the energy saving— so geese, for example, may make an energy saving of only 2.4%.\n",
      "“In our study, pelicans often had difficulty staying within the formation, particularly when flying at the rear. But even though these birds were regularly adjusting their position, they still achieved a significant energy saving. This saving may be only partly due to effects of the wakes of other birds on the power input that results from formation flight itself. When flying in formation, pelicans appear to beat their wings less frequently and to glide for longer periods. A rough calculation based on our estimates of the proportion of time spent flapping and gliding in formation, and assuming that the overall costs of the glide–flap sequence is the sum of the gliding and flapping components, reveals an actual saving of 1.7–3.4% as a result of wake effects on power input — this value is comparable to that estimated for geese.\n",

      "“The present review describes the ombrohydrochoric dispersal syndrome in plants, i.e. seed expulsion by raindrops. There are two different ombrohydrochoric dispersal modes – dispersal by rain wash and by ballistic forces. Both have been reported from the understory of tropical and temperate forests, from wetlands and from deserts, and from numerous families and genera. A special form of ombrohydrochoric dispersal is the jet-action rain-operated seed dispersal mechanism which is restricted to the semi-desert ice plants, Aizoaceae, one of the major families of the angiosperms. Within this family, 98% of the species possess hygrochastic capsules with an ombrohydrochoric seed dispersal mechanism which in part are also responsible for the remarkable speciation burst and radiation. The highly complex capsules open when wet, and the seeds are expelled by a ‘jet action’ with the kinetic energy of raindrops. The halves of the covering membranes of a locule form a nozzle near the centre of the capsule which serves as a jet. Drops of water falling on the distal opening (after the locule has been filled with water) result in an explosive expulsion of water droplets and seeds through that jet. More seeds are dispersed further away from the capsule than in those capsule types without such a jet mechanism.” (Parolin 2007:511)\n",

Some of these construct sand trenches or ridges to catch the fog, while Onymacris unguicularis and O. bicolor instead utilise their own body surface as a fog water collector [7-9]. By adopting a head standing posture facing into the wind, the fog water collects on their elytra and runs down to their mouth, to be imbibed by the beetles. This unique behaviour is termed fog-basking [7]. The advantage of fog collection for water intake in the extremely arid desert is obvious, and becomes critical when rainfall is absent over prolonged periods of time. Long term studies on the population density of Darkling beetles in the Namib Desert clearly shows that the fog collecting beetles are still present in great numbers during periods of low rain fall, whereas the large majority of Darkling beetles that lack this adaptation disappear or decline to less than 1% of their mean abundance [5].” (Norgaard and Dacke 2010:1-2)\n",

The surface properties (infra-red emissivity, wetting properties) were dominated by the wax at the elytra surface and, to a lower extent, its micro-structure… Dew formation occurred on the insect’s elytra, which can be explained by these surface properties. From the surface coverage of the condensed drops it was found that dew forms primarily in the valleys between the bumps. The difference in droplet nucleation rate between bumps and valleys can be attributed to the hexagonal microstructure on the surface of the valleys, whereas the surface of the bumps is smooth.

      "“Hagfishes are known for producing large volumes of slime when stressed. Their slime is believed to act as a defence mechanism against gill-breathing predators, as it has been shown to reduce water flow over the gills of fish. Hagfish slime is composed of two interacting components, slime thread skeins and mucin vesicles, which are both released from glands along the ventrolateral length of the animal. Each slime gland is surrounded by striated muscle and a connective tissue capsule, and contains large numbers of gland thread cells and gland mucous cells. Gland thread cells contain skeins of tightly coiled polymers rich in intermediate filaments, while gland mucous cells produce vesicles containing mucins, a class of glycoproteins. Both cell types rupture partially as they pass through the slime gland duct, causing each to lose its plasma membrane, and releasing both thread skeins and mucin vesicles into the external environment. The mucin vesicles are released by holocrine secretion rather than the more typical mechanism of mucus secretion through fusion of vesicles with the membrane of the mucous cell and release of mucin granules by exocytosis. In this way, the mucin vesicles remain intact until they come into contact with seawater in the external environment.\n",
      "“The mature slime is formed when exudate released from the hagfish contacts convectively mixing seawater. Agitation during mixing causes the thread skeins to uncoil to lengths of 10–17 cm, providing a large surface area to which the mucins released from the ruptured vesicles can attach. The fully formed slime is a complex network capable of confining seawater to channels between the slime threads and ruptured mucins like a fine sieve. The interaction between the thread skeins and ruptured mucins is critical for the production of the mature slime.” (Herr et al. 2010:1092; in-line citations removed from quote)\n",
      "“When agitated, Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) produce large quantities of slime that consists of hydrated bundles of protein filaments and membrane-bound mucin vesicles from numerous slime glands. When the slime exudate contacts seawater, the thread bundles unravel and the mucin vesicles swell and rupture. Little is known about the mechanisms of vesicle rupture in seawater and stabilization within the gland, although it is believed that the vesicle membrane is permeable to most ions except polyvalent anions. We hypothesized that the most abundant compounds within the slime gland exudate have a stabilizing effect on the mucin vesicles. To test this hypothesis, we measured the chemical composition of the fluid component of hagfish slime exudate and conducted functional assays with these solutes to test their ability to keep the vesicles in a condensed state. We found K+ concentrations that were elevated relative to plasma, and Na+, Cl– and Ca2+ concentrations that were considerably lower. Our analysis also revealed high levels of methylamines such as trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), betaine and dimethylglycine, which had a combined concentration of 388 mmol l–1 in the glandular fluid. In vitro rupture assays demonstrated that both TMAO and betaine had a significant effect on rupture, but neither was capable of completely abolishing mucin swelling and rupture, even at high concentrations. This suggests that some other mechanism such as the chemical microenvironment within gland mucous cells, or hydrostatic pressure is responsible for stabilization of the vesicles within the gland.” (Herr et al. 2010:1092)\n",
      "“…[hagfish] slime originates as a two-component glandular exudate comprised of coiled bundles of cytoskeletal intermediate filaments (thread skeins) and mucin vesicles…Deployment of the thread skeins involves their unraveling in a fraction of a second from a 150 µm-long ellipsoid bundle to a thread that is 100x longer. We hypothesized that thread skein deployment requires both vigorous hydrodynamic mixing and the presence of mucin vesicles, both of which are required for whole slime deployment. Here we provide evidence that mixing and mucin vesicles are indeed crucial for skein unraveling.” (Winegard & Fudge 2010:1235)\n",
      "“Our video deployments confirmed the hypothesis that hagfish use slime secretion as an effective defence mechanism against predation. The footage we obtained showed that slime can affect gill-breathing predators by clogging gills, likely by increasing the resistance to water flow.” (Zintzen et al. 2011:2)\n",
      "“What triggers the slime secretion is likely to be direct skin stimulation by a predator. Active slime secretion was not observed when the potential predator approached the hagfish, but only began when the predator either tried to bite or engulf the hagfish. The mechanism of localised control and coordination of slime glands, as observed in our video footage, has been documented in laboratory studies and was highly effective to allow a full escape. It was also fast enough to prevent any injury to the hagfishes.” (Zintzen et al. 2011:3)\n",

It swallows great quantities of plankton, straining it from the water via specialized filters called gill-rakers. A common sight drifting just beneath the sea surface during the plankton-rich summer months, these sharks are rarely seen during the winter, when plankton is scarce. This is because they descend to deeper waters where, scientists assumed, they spend the season in a torpid state. However, when scientists examined two basking sharks during winter they lacked gill-rakers and thus couldn’t feed. This unexpected finding suggests that basking sharks hibernate, shedding their gill-rakers and regrowing them in spring.” (Shuker 2001:108)\n",

      "“The cnidocyst is the defining organelle of the cnidarians, used for capture of prey and defense…nematocysts comprise a powerful molecular spring mechanism releasing energy stored in the wall polymer in the nanosecond time range…The nematocyst is product of a giant post-Golgi vesicle…It consists of several different protein species that assemble into a large capsular structure with a long spiny tubule inside. The matrix is built up by poly-γ-glutamate, which binds a 2 M concentration of cations, thereby creating a high osmotic intra-capsular pressure of more than 150 bar…the nematocyst vesicle is docked at the apical side of the cell. Mechanical stimulation of the sensory receptor of the nematocyte, the cnidocil, elicits an action potential, which in turn triggers Ca2+-dependent discharge.” (Özbek et al. 2009:1038)\n",
      "“Within less than 3 ms the tubule evaginates and injects toxins into the prey…On the molecular level, the nematocyst is designed to withstand this extreme mechanical stress by combining high resistance and flexibility. The major constituents of the capsule wall are mini-collagens, a family of unusually short collagens…in a three-dimensional polymer stabilized by disulfide bonds…and [cross-linked] NOWA protein. They form a continuous supra-structure of the nematocyst wall…All nematocysts have a solid, elastic wall and a lid structure, which closes the capsule before discharge…the capsules of the highest structural complexity are found in hydrozoans. Here, the stenoteles represent one of the most sophisticated capsule types. The stenotele tubule is enlarged at its basal region, which is called the shaft. The distal shaft carries the stylet apparatus, which contains three huge stylets and three arrays of thinner spines. This stylet apparatus forms a dart when the tubule evaginates, which punches a whole into the prey’s cuticle through which the long tubule enters, releasing hemolytic and neurotoxic substances…The dart-like stylet apparatus can penetrate even thick crustacean cuticles…It is generally accepted today that the high osmotic pressure that is built up at the end of capsule morphogenesis in conjunction with the elastically stretched capsular wall is the main driving force of discharge. At the end of morphogenesis the capsule is maximally expanded and during discharge the volume gets suddenly reduced again by about 50%…The high osmotic pressure is generated by poly-γ-glutamate and…anions…They are responsible for the generation and regulation of an internal osmotic pressure that amounts up to 150 bar…a high osmotic pressure inside the capsule is the basic principle of all nematocysts.” (Özbek et al. 2009:1039)\n",
      "“[T]he molecular assembly of the operculum enables it to react to the ionic changes preceding discharge by a molecular rearrangement facilitating capsule wall disintegration at this position. Thus, the release of the increased osmotic pressure would be directed to the preformed opening preventing a random rupture of the wall structure.” (Özbek et al. 2009:1040)\n",
      "“[A]n action potential that is normally elicited when a prey mechanically deflects the sensory receptor of the cell, the cnidocil…extracellular calcium entering the nematocyte leads to fusion pore formation during nematocyst exocytosis…In phase B the nematocyst vesicle fuses with the nematocyte membrane, and the capsule’s discharge process starts. The most obvious event is that the lid is opened and the stylet-bearing portion of the tubule is ejected…an average velocity (y) of the stylet tip of 18.6 m/s is generated…5,413,000 x g is required to produce this average velocity (y) from a standing start. This high acceleration can explain how a small mass can generate sufficient force at the site of impact. The stylets are composed of a keratin-like protein and have an extremely narrow tip. Based on the accelerated mass and the stylets tip (80 nm2), a pressure (p) of 7.7 GPa was estimated when the stylet tip hits the prey. This force is in the range of technical bullets and explains how a 5 mm thick solid cuticle of a crustacean prey can be effectively perforated by a cnidarian nematocyst with a minimum of mass. This seems to be the fastest known process generated in animal systems…[prior to discharge] the cyst is in its maximally expanded state and only a minimal increase in pressure is sufficient to elicit discharge…Spinalin, a keratin-like glycine- and histidine-rich protein, is involved in the formation of spine and operculum structures.” (Özbek et al. 2009:1041)\n",

      "“The mystery behind the clownfish and sea anemone relationship is how the clownfish avoids being stung and killed by its host anemone. Of the numerous theories that have been presented over the years to explain this relationship, the focus is now on a layer of mucus that coats the clownfish. ‘The fish are not immune to being stung,’ said [Daphne] Fautin. ‘But their mucus coat protects them. The debate is the source of the mucus.’ One theory holds that the fish produce the mucus themselves and that it contains chemicals that prevent the anemone nematocysts from stinging as they do other fish in the sea. The other theory is that the clownfish rub themselves against the anemone tentacles in elaborate dances, smearing anemone mucus over themselves. This coating tricks the anemone into confusing the fish for itself. ‘There is evidence for both,’ said Fautin. ‘And since there is a wide variety of anemone hosts, and 28 species of fish, I am convinced these views present two ends of a spectrum, and a combination is probably true for many.'” (Roach 2003)\n",

These appear to be stereotyped behaviors that the fishes invariably exhibit upon initial contact with an anemone, whether or not the fishes are already protected.” (Elliot 1997: 287)\n",
      "“Anemonefishes are known to have a protective mucous coat that allows them to contact the tentacles of their host anemone without being stung. There are two conflicting hypotheses as to the source and biochemical properties of this mucous coating. One hypothesis proposes that anemonefishes acquire anemone substances from their hosts during the behavioral process of acclimation, that protect the fish from being stung. Anemonefishes are considered to use anemone mucus as “chemical camouflage” or “macromolecular mimicry” to avoid recognition as “not-self” by the anemone, and possible subsequent stinging. Another hypothesis is that anemonefishes produce their own protective mucus coat, which lacks substances that elicit cnida (nematocyst and spirocyst) discharge by their hosts…ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) tests showed that anemone mucus antigens were present in the mucous coating of associated anemonefish, but not naive fish. This showed that an innately protected A. clarkii does not produce a mucus coat that is biochemically similar to that of anemones, but that the same fish does acquire anemone substances in its mucus coat when it associates with anemones in aquaria.” (Elliot 1994)\n",

      "“Natural materials often exhibit excellent mechanical properties. An example of outstanding impact resistance is the pummelo fruit (Citrus maxima) which can drop from heights of 10 m and more without showing significant outer damage. Our data suggest that this impact resistance is due to the hierarchical organization of the fruit peel, called pericarp.” (Fischer 2010: B658)\n",
      "“Citrus maxima is the largest fruit among the genus Citrus with a fruit weight up to 6 kg and a maximal height of the fruit bearing trees of 15 m. In combination these two factors, fruit weight and the height of the fruit bearing branches, cause a high potential energy of the hanging fruit. After the fruit is shed its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy which reaches its maximum just before impact with the ground. If the high kinetic energy was to cause the pummelos to split open when impacting with the ground, the fruits would perish within a short time due to the tropical climate in Southeast Asia, the region of origin of the genus Citrus.” (Fischer 2010: B659)\n",
      "“Semi-quantitative analyses of thin sections of pummelo peel revealed a gradual transition in density between exocarp and mesocarp. Thus, structurally, the dense exocarp cannot be separated clearly from the spongy mesocarp. We hypothesize that due to this lack of an abrupt change in tissue composition and therefore in structural and mechanical properties the risk of delamination of the tissues during impact is reduced. The impact force acting on the pummelo depends on the velocity of the fruit before impact and its weight, but also on the consistency of the ground. Under natural conditions, part of the total energy is dissipated by the relatively pliable ground, as typically existing in the regions where pummelos grow naturally. In the tests presented mechanical loads acting on the fruits were increased by dropping the fruits onto a hard ground. Thus all kinetic energy must have been dissipated by the fruits themselves. The mesocarp with its air-filled intercellular spaces represents a compressible foam. As the Young’s modulus of this spongy part of the peel is rather low, we conclude that its ability to dissipate large amounts of energy must result from the structural composition of the peel.” (Fischer 2010: B662)\n",

      "“When provoked, Notaden bennetti frogs secrete an exudate which rapidly forms a tacky elastic solid (‘frog glue’). This protein-based material acts as a promiscuous pressure-sensitive adhesive that functions even in wet conditions. We conducted macroscopic tests in air to assess the tensile strength of moist glue (up to 78 + 8 kPa) and the shear strength of dry glue (1.7 + 0.3 MPa). We also performed nanomechanical measurements in water to determine the adhesion (1.9-7.2 nN or greater), resilience (43-56%), and elastic modulus (170-1035 kPa) of solid glue collected in different ways. Dry glue contains little carbohydrate and consists mainly of protein. The protein complement is rich in Gly (15.8 mol %), Pro (8.8 mol %), and Glu/Gln (14.1 mol %); it also contains some 4-hydroxyproline (4.6 mol %) but no 5-hydroxylysine or 3,4- dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa). Denaturing gel electrophoresis of the glue reveals a characteristic pattern of proteins spanning 13-400 kDa. The largest protein (Nb-1R, apparent molecular mass 350-500 kDa) is also the most abundant, and this protein appears to be the key structural component. The solid glue can be dissolved in dilute acids; raising the ionic strength causes the glue components to self-assemble spontaneously into a solid which resembles the starting material. We describe scattering studies on dissolved and solid glue and provide microscopy images of glue surfaces and sections, revealing a porous interior that is consistent with the high water content (85-90 wt %) of moist glue. In addition to compositional similarities with other biological adhesives and well-known elastomeric proteins, the circular dichroism spectrum of dissolved glue is almost identical to that for soluble elastin and electron and scanning probe microscopy images invite comparison with silk fibroins. Covalent cross-linking does not seem to be necessary for the glue to set.” (Graham et al. 2005:3300)\n",

Since some of the cavity radii…equate to pores with diameters in excess of 10 µm, it is likely that the hydrated material will also permit a degree of cellular infiltration.

      "“This work reports an engineering inspiration of the cuticular nanostructures found in a fire?y lantern. The light organs exist on the abdominal segments of a fire?y (Luciola lateralis Motschulsky) in males, as shown in Fig. 1B. Unlike the normal (N), the lantern (L) cuticle has longitudinal nanostructures with a highly ordered arrangement along the sagittal plane of a fire?y body (Fig. 1 C–E). The physical dimensions were statistically extracted from the SEM images. The period, height, and width roughly range near 250 nm, 110 nm, and 150 nm, respectively. For further investigation, the bioluminescent spectra were measured with a microscopic spectrometer and the result shows a center wavelength of 563 nm in males (68 nm in bandwidth). The transmittance of bioluminescent light (λ= 560 nm) through the lantern cuticle was calculated by using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) method (Fig. 1F). The refractive index of chitin as cuticle medium (reported value: 1.56) (20) was chosen for this FDTD calculation. The maximum transmission are clearly shown at 250 nm in period, 150 nm in width, and 110 nm in height, very similar to what is observed in nature. The nanostructured surface serves as a single layer with the calculated effective refractive index of roughly 1.24 (21), the thickness of which matches well with a quarter wavelength over the square root of refractive index in cuticular medium (i.e., the antireflection condition). This result indicates that the highly ordered cuticular nanostructures surrounding the ventral photogenic layer play an important role for reducing the index mismatch between air and the cuticle surface for high light extraction of bioluminescent light. For an anatomical perspective, a fire?y lantern consists of a dorsal layer, a photogenic layer, and a cuticle (Fig. 1G). The photogenic layer emits bioluminescent light in all directions. The light passes through the cuticle either directly or after reflecting off the dorsal layer, which is located under the photogenic layer and also known as a dielectric mirror (17, 18, 22). The natural design can inspire the configuration of high-power LED packages” (Kim et al. 2012:1-2).\n",

      "In nest construction, many social wasps use an oral secretion to cement together nest material, e.g. plant fibers, primarily composed of cellulose. Nests are water-resistant (McGovern et al. 1988) due to the saliva-cellulose matrix. The chitin-like saliva is primarily protein with high proline content. When mixed with the cellulose, it dries quickly and irreversibly to a water insoluble, water repellant surface. In general, wasps in rainy environments add more saliva to the mixture (Kudo et al. 1998), because the saliva’s mucoproteins provide adhesive and hydrophobic properties (Wainwright et al. 1976). “P.

      "“One particular use of a collagenous rope gives a sense of the range of performance nature can get from this material–and of some of the peculiarities of applying data from standard analyses. As familiar to anyone who has poked around rocky, wave-swept shores, mussels don’t dislodge easily. Each is attached to rocks by twenty to sixty stringy byssus threads of sufficient tenacity to resist extreme hydrodynamic forces. (Denny [1988] provides an especially good view of the origin of these forces.) At first glance, a collagenous material looks inappropriate for the mission. After all, low extensibility means that unless particularly well matched and faced with forces of invariant strength and direction, only some subset of threads will bear the load. Imagine hanging from a group of inextensible ropes each of slightly different length–having more than one will gain you nothing, since they’ll break one by one instead of sharing the load.\n",
      "A byssus thread contains two mechanically distinct regions, called, for their distance from the shell, proximal and distal. The material of both regions proves to be unusually extensible for collagens, which sounds right and proper. But then, according to Bell and Gosline (1996) things get more complex. The proximal region can be strained to a greater fraction of unloaded length, but it never achieves the breaking strength of the distal region, as you can see from figure 16.14a. So it looks as if their proximal regions take care of distributing the load among the threads. Not so. The distal region of threads happens to be two to four times longer and only half as wide. So a given force will stretch it quite far. Replotting the data as force against extension for a whole thread as a structure, as in figure 16.14b, shows a nice match. Even better, it shows how the distal thread yields (the horizontal portion of its curve) just short of the breaking force–an extension that will permit threads to reorient closer to the direction of the applied force and to share increasing loads among an increasing number of threads.” (Vogel 2003:347)\n",

The tissues contain a large amount of the extracellular matrix, mainly consisting of collagen fibrils, proteoglycans and microfibrils. The unique properties of these collagenous tissues might be due to lack of permanent associations between the collagen fibrils and the surrounding extracellular matrix because it is easy to isolate collagen fibrils from catch connective tissues – unlike collagenous tissues of adult vertebrates. It seems that crosslinking of the collagen fibrils with adjacent ones and other components of the extracellular matrix is formed or broken during changes in the mechanical properties of catch connective tissues. The molecular mechanisms underlying the change are, however, not yet fully understood. The holothurian body wall dermis is a typical catch connective tissue that shows rapid and reversible changes in its mechanical properties in response to various stimuli. Extensive studies on the dynamic mechanical properties of the dermis of the sea cucumber Actinopyga mauritiana revealed that the tissue can adopt at least three different states. These are stiff, standard and soft states, which can be distinguished by elastic and viscous properties and by strain-dependent behaviors…The mechanical parameters of the standard state are not simply the intermediate values between the stiff and the soft states, suggesting that the molecular mechanism converting the soft to the standard state is different from that converting the standard to the stiff state.” (Yamada et al. 2010:3416)\n",

However, for more than 3000 years, lotus plants have been cultivated as a crop in Far-East Asia, where they are used for food, medicine and play a significant role in religious and cultural activities. Holder of the world’s record for long-term seed viability (1300 years) is a lotus fruit (China Antique) from Xipaozi, Liaoning Province, China. Five offspring of this variety, from 200-500-year-old fruits (14C dates) collected at Xipaozi, have recently been germinated, and are the first such seedlings to be raised from directly dated fruits. The fruits at Xipaozi, preserved in a dry ancient lakebed, have been exposed to low-dose γ-radiation for hundreds of years (having an accumulated soil irradiation of 0.1-1.0 Gy). Offspring from these old fruits show abnormalities that resemble those in various modern seedlings irradiated at much higher doses. Although these lotus offspring are phenotypically abnormal, the viability of old seeds was evidently not affected by accumulated doses of up to 3 Gy. Growth characteristics of first- and second-year lotus offspring of these fruits, products of the longest-term radiobiological experiment on record, are summarized here (rapid early growth, phenotypic abnormalities, lack of vigour, poor rhizome development and low photosynthetic activity during second-year growth). Aspects of their chromosomal organization, phenotype and physiology (rapid recovery from stress, heat-stable proteins, protein-repair enzyme) are discussed. Important unsolved problems are suggested to elicit interest among members of the seed science community to the study of old fruits recently collected at Xipaozi, with particular emphasis on aspects of ageing and repair.” (Shen-Miller 2002:131)\n",

Their function, trapping solar energy photosynthetically, demands exposure of lots of area skyward…[Nature] arranges leaves and their attachments so they adjust their configurations and thus reduce their exposure and flutter as the wind increases. Motive force presents no problem, even for these nonmuscular structures, because the wind itself provides more than enough. Photosynthesis? Intermittently strong winds come mostly with reduced sunlight, so temporary reduction in exposure to sky can’t entail a great long-term cost…Figure 1.5a shows what one kind of leaf, that of a tulip poplar, does at a series of increasing wind speeds. This curling into a tightening cone characterizes quite a few kinds of leaves–including maples, sweet gums, sycamores (plane trees), and redbuds…All are characterized by relatively long petioles (leaf stems) and lobes on their blades that protrude back toward their parent branches from the point of attachment of their petioles. What appears to happen (based on observation and crude models) is that the lobes, upwind because leaves always extend downwind like kites on strings, bend upward (abaxially, technically) and get the curling started…This curling into cones dramatically reduces drag–at least if we pick the right item for a comparative baseline…Another wind-dependent reconfiguration, one in which the leaflets of a pinnately compound leaf such as black walnut or black locust roll up around their axial rachis, does a bit better…The very stiff leaves on a branch of a holly (Ilex americana) swing inward toward the branch and lie, one against another, in a common sandwichlike pile. Pine needles cluster instead of being splayed outward…The solution…involves two aspects as common in nature’s technology as they are rare in our own. First, shape isn’t held constant, but rather shape and the forces of flow interact complexly, each dependent on the other. The local wind forces on a leaf depend (in part) on its shape; its shape, in turn, depends (in part) on the local wind forces. Second, variable circumstances are dealt with by altering functional priorities. Photosynthesis, overall, matters far more than drag minimization; in storms, though, such priorities must reverse.” (Vogel 2003: 8-10)\n",

      "“Because this first visible sign of the [bracket] fungus only appears when the tree is elderly or already stricken, it is usually assumed that it is the fungus that has infected the tree like a disease and is bringing about its death. But that is hardly just. The fungus has not attacked the living tissues of the tree, only the dead timber. And now, far from harming the tree, it brings it considerable advantages.\n",
      "“To start with, the remains of the wood, after the fungus has digested it, are in a form that the tree can absorb. So as this rotted pulp accumulates on the ground within the hollowed trunk, the oak puts out small roots into what was once its centre to reclaim some part of its lifetime savings. And there is new valuable nutriment there too. The hollow trunk has become an attractive home for animals. Bats roost in it, hanging from its walls. Owls nest there. And droppings from these creatures fall on to the ground within and provide further rich sustenance for the tree.\n",
      "“The removal of the tree’s dead heart brings yet another advantage. The change of form from solid pillar to hollow cylinder alters the way in which the trunk reacts to mechanical stress. It is much more resilient and stable. The removal of many tons of timber also reduces the strain on the tree’s elderly and doubtless somewhat decayed root system. The result is that an old hollow tree is often able to withstand a gale better than a younger undecayed one. In the ancient hunting parks of England such as Windsor, where trees stand out in the open, unprotected by others from the wind, it is by no means rare after a storm to discover that hollow oaks, four or five hundred years old, remain upright when younger ones, a quarter their age, have been blown over. Tree and fungus, each pursuing its own best interests, have come together to the benefit of both.” (Attenborough 1995:213-214)\n",

      "“Many understory plants rely on diffuse light for photosynthesis because direct light is usually scattered by upper canopy layers before it strikes the forest floor. There is a considerable gap in the literature concerning the interaction of direct and diffuse light with leaves. Some understory plants have well-developed lens-shaped epidermal cells, which have long been thought to increase the absorption of diffuse light. To assess the role of epidermal cell shape in capturing direct vs. diffuse light, we measured leaf reflectance and transmittance with an integrating sphere system using leaves with flat (Begonia erythrophylla, Citrus reticulata, and Ficus benjamina) and lens-shaped epidermal cells (B. bowerae, Colocasia esculenta, and Impatiens velvetea). In all species examined, more light was absorbed when leaves were irradiated with direct as opposed to diffuse light. When leaves were irradiated with diffuse light, more light was transmitted and more was reflected in both leaf types, resulting in absorptance values 2–3% lower than in leaves irradiated with direct light. These data suggest that lens-shaped epidermal cells do not aid the capture of diffuse light. Palisade and mesophyll cell anatomy and leaf thickness appear to have more influence in the capture and absorption of light than does epidermal cell shape…Lens cells may then be more important for the focusing of direct light (Vogelmann et al., 1996) or for other reasons such as storing water and improving the hydrophobicity of the leaf surface. The development of these lens-shaped cells in understory tropical species may be primarily related to chance opportunities to exposure to direct light when sun flecks penetrate to the ground level of the forest. In addition, plants with these types of cells typically have an extremely hydrophobic surface, and convexly shaped cells increase water repellency (Wagner et al., 2003; Bhushan and Jung, 2006).” (Brodersen and Vogelmann 2007:1061, 1065)\n",

It has a retardation time (calculated by Biggs; see Vincent [1990]) of a little under an hour. How nice! The pulsating or reversing flows of waves passing above won’t sweep it about very much, but after it has hunkered down, the low-pressure ciliary pump will be adequate to pump it back up again, albeit slowly. It can stand up to a single wave but deflect in a tidal current that imposes the same drag. Furthermore, the anemone’s body wall can resist the stresses of its own short-term muscle contractions, so it can bend or straighten without getting an aneurysm whenever its muscles aren’t active.” (Vogel 2003:360-361)\n",

The binding, though, is as much physical as chemical – the water in the soil interstices lie in tiny recesses between soil crumbs where it has minimized its exposed interface with air (Rose 1966). For the roots of a plant to extract the water requires making more surface, and thus it takes a very great pull, one that appears as an additional (negative) component of the pressure in the vessels running up a stem or trunk. The lowest (most negative) pressures known in plants occur in desert shrubs, which must suck really hard on the ground to get any water out. The most extreme value on record is, I think, minus 120 atmospheres (Schlessinger et al. 1982) – that would hold up a column water over 1,200 meters (4,000 feet) high.

Chloride channels are involved in a broad range of physiological functions, including the transepithelial transport, cell volume regulation, stabilization of membrane potential, synaptic inhibition, extracellular and vesicular acidification, and endocytotic trafficking that may be tissue-, cell type-specific or housekeeping distribution in various tissues.” (Tang et al. 2010:688)\n",
      "“Cl− is the most abundant anion in animal tissue and plasma. Moreover, chloride channels play essential roles in the regulation of cellular excitability, transepithelial transport, cell volume regulation and acidification of intracellular organelles…Osmoregulation and ion balance in teleosts is predominantly performed by the transportation of relevant ions (Na+ and Cl–) through epithelial transporter systems across the gill, the major osmoregulatory tissue. In order to maintain homeostasis of plasma osmolality and ion components, marine or freshwater (FW) teleosts excrete excess salts of the blood to hyperosmotic environments or actively absorb salts from external hyposmotic environments, respectively, via the gill epithelial transport systems. The systems used by teleosts to adapt to seawater (SW) or FW differ not only in the direction of ion and water movements but also in the molecular components of the transporters. Most teleosts are stenohaline fishes, living entirely in either SW or FW. Because euryhaline teleosts adapt to either SW or FW by efficiently switching epithelial transporter systems, they exhibit great ability to maintain plasma osmolality within narrow physiological ranges in different salinity environments.” (Tang et al. 2010:683)\n",
      "“The current ion-transporting system depicted in the working model for NaCl secretion of gill epithelial ionocytes in SW teleosts includes (Fig. 1) the ouabain-inhibited Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA) and bumetanide-sensitive Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) located in the basolateral membrane; the anion channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the apical membrane; and the tight-junction proteins, claudins, and occludins, located between adjacent epithelial cells. The basolateral NKCC1 mediates the entry of Na+ and Cl- into the cellular compartment down the electrochemical gradient provided by NKA, followed by passive exit of Cl- and Na+, respectively, through the apical channel CFTR and paracellular tight-junction pathway…Functional NKA consists of two protein subunits, the catalytic alpha-subunit and glycoprotein beta-subunit, assembled in a 1:1 ratio to create an alphabeta-heterodimer. NKA provides an electrochemical gradient to drive operations of other transport pathways and exhibits four alpha- (alpha1 ~ 4) and three beta-isoforms (beta1 ~ 3) in mammals…NKCC1 is thought to be the secretory isoform of NKCC, a member of the SLC12A family…In gills of these species, the main expressed isoform is the NKCC1a gene. Furthermore, using whole-mount in situ hybridization, the NKCC1a gene was demonstrated to be localized in ionocytes of medaka gills, which supports immunocytochemical data from extensive previous studies. When euryhaline teleosts were exposed to SW, increased mRNA levels of branchial NKCC1a and elevated protein levels of branchial NKCC1 were reported. The observations strongly suggest a role of NKCC1a in the NaCl secretion function in gill ionocytes of euryhaline teleosts during acclimation to SW. The CFTR, a cAMP-activated Cl- channel (ClC), mainly appears in branchial ionocytes of SW fish, indicating its role in NaCl secretion upon salinity challenge…This accumulated evidence supports the crucial role of CFTR, similar to that of NKCC, in NaCl secretion function in SW fish gill ionocytes.” (Hwang et al. 2011:R28-R30)\n",

      "“A forest ‘remembers’ its predisturbance composition and structure by the presence of at least three interacting parts (Nystrom and Folke 2001; Lundberg and Moberg 2003; Folke et al. 2004): biological legacies, mobile links, and support areas. Biological legacies are species, patterns, or structures that persist within a disturbed area and act as sources of ecosystem recovery, such as large living and dead trees or tree clusters that provide seeds, buried rhizomes or roots, and nutrients to the regenerating stand (Franklin and MacMahon 2000). In some cases these legacies may be biased towards structures or patches that are more likely to survive the disturbance, such as wet or low-lying sites during forest fires. Mobile links are ‘keystone’ organisms that move between habitats and ecosystems after a disturbance to provide essential ecosystem processes that are lacking, such as pollination, seed dispersal, or nutrient translocation, by connecting areas that may be widely separated spatially or temporally (Lundberg and Moberg 2003). Support areas refer to landscape patches or habitats that maintain viable populations of mobile links (Lundberg and Moberg 2003). Together these interacting parts play a pivotal role in renewal and reorganization of a disturbed system.” (Drever et al. 2006:2289-2290)\n",
      "“We term this network of species, their dynamic interactions between each other and the environment, and the combination of structures that make reorganization after disturbance possible; the ‘ecological memory’ of the system (21, 22)…The ecological memory is a key component of ecological resilience, i.e. the capacity of the system to absorb disturbances, reorganize, and maintain adaptive capacity (25)…The ecosystem renewal cycle in forests gives rise to a coarse mosaic of patches in different stages of a forest cycle (67), initiated by disturbance and comprising a series of structural phases; commonly recognized are the i) gap (in our terms reorganization), ii) building (exploitation), iii) mature (conservation), and eventually iv) degenerative (release) phases (68, 69). The build-up of ecological memory in the form of biological legacies and species in the mosaic landscape usually takes several forest generations during which the soil is formed and nutrient pools and decomposer organisms are accumulated. Although it is common to characterize forest types by particular disturbance regimes, most forests are affected by various disturbances acting at different temporal and spatial scales (Fig. 3; 70-73). Organisms in natural forests have adapted, over evolutionary time, to the characteristic disturbance regimes of these forests. Boreal taiga forests and Mediterranean forests (74) are often disturbed by large-scale fires, while temperate deciduous forests, e.g. beech in Central Europe, mainly are affected by small-scale windthrows.” (Bengtsson et al. 2003:389, 392, 393)\n",

After ?eld observations, measurements of the optical properties in the two main stable color states and scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope investigations, a physical mechanism is proposed to explain the color switching of this insect. It is shown that the gold coloration displayed by animals at rest arises from a chirped multilayer re?ector maintained in a perfect coherent state by the presence of humidity in the porous patches within each layer, while the red color displayed by disturbed animals results from the destruction of this re?ector by the expulsion of the liquid from the porous patches, turning the multilayer into a translucent slab that leaves an unobstructed view of the deeper-lying, pigmented red substrate. This mechanism not only explains the change of hue but also the change of scattering mode from specular to diffuse…We can refer to this behavior as ‘hygro-chrome,’ underlining the change of color with varying hygrometry. Tunable materials like electrochrome ?lms change color with varying applied electric ?elds or thermo-chrome ?lms that change color with varying temperatures all have a strong potential for applications in sensing or switching devices” (Vigneron et al. 2007: 1, 10).\n",

The reason that members of these two families resemble one another so closely is that similar conditions of heat and drought have stimulated the same physical response.

So its design, as in figure 18.8, ought to reflect gravitational loading. Which it does, but more by using internal material anisotropy than externally obvious cross-sectional specialization. It uses thick-walled, liquid-filled cells along its bottom, which resist compression well, and long cells with lengthwise fibers along the top, which act as ropy tension resistors. The petiole and midrib are as truly cantilevers as any protruding I-beam, but internal structure–anisotropy at various levels–matters at least as much as overall cross section in efficiently dealing with gravity. And the rest of the leaf blade, an extension of the cantilever, faces much the same mechanical situation. Veins protrude downward to get some height to the beam and to continue the compression-resisting material of petiole and midrib.

For example, Burdock plants had a direct impact on the invention of a novel hooking system, while the lotus leaf has inspired the creation of very hydrophobic surfaces. The elastic response of plants when exposed to external stimuli water, light, etc. is also rather interesting,and emerging biomimetic materials may just take advantage of this. Plant leaves are often stiff while fully hydrated but loose turgor and become soft under dry conditions. If they dry completely up, only the cellular matrix remains, and the leaf appears to be hard and brittle. However, some plants have a conceptually simpler elastic response, where the plant leaf is stiff in the dry state and soft in the wet state. Here, we study the resurrection fern Polypodium polypodioides, which has an amazing ability to take up water while at the same time altering its elasticity from a soft hydrated state to a stiff dehydrated state in order to cope with drought. Moreover, as reported in Ref. 6, the fern can reproducibly switch between a curled-up dry state and a fully extended and soft wet state and is, therefore, a natural shape-memory material.” (Helseth 2008:1)\n",

Their stiff close-packed feathers form a thick insulating mat that is impervious to water and provides a good streamlined surface for swimming.” (Foy and Oxford Scientific Films 1982:111)\n",
      "“Several studies have investigated the thermal resistance of penguin ‘coats’ (feather and skin assembly) and found it to be surprisingly low—an average of 0.74 m2KW-1 or 7.4 Tog. Penguin feathers are heavily modified, being short (30-40 mm), stiff and lance shaped. Insulation is provided by a long (20-30 mm) afterfeather. Penguins are unique in that the feathers are evenly packed over the surface of the body (30-40 per cm2) rather than arranged in tracts. For insulation the penguin requires a thick, air-filled, windproof coat (similar to an open-cell foam covered with a windproof layer) that eliminates convection and reduces radiative and convective heat losses to a minimum. However, when diving, the penguin requires a thin, smooth and waterproof coat with no trapped air (positive buoyancy would be a big disadvantage to an active swimming hunter). It achieves this by using muscles attached to the shaft of the feather to ‘lock down’ the feathers to create a water-tight barrier. In addition, the feather rachis is flattened dorso-ventrally allowing it to bend and conform to the body shape readily with increasing water pressure.” (Dawson et al. 1999:199)\n",

      "“The various silks that make up the web of the orb web spiders have been studied extensively. However, success in prey capture depends as much on the web glue as on the fibers. Spider silk glue, which is considered one of the strongest and most effective biological glues, is an aqueous solution secreted from the orb weaving spider’s aggregate glands and coats the spiral prey capturing threads of their webs. Studies identified the major component of the glue as microscopic nodules made of a glycoprotein. This study describes two newly discovered proteins that form the glue-glycoprotein of the golden orb weaving spider Nephila clavipes. Our results demonstrate that both proteins contain unique 110 amino acid repetitive domains that are encoded by opposite strands of the same DNA sequence. Thus, the genome of the spider encodes two distinct yet functionally related genes by using both strands of an identical DNA sequence. Moreover, the closest match for the nonrepetitive region of one of the proteins is chitin binding proteins. The web glue appears to have evolved a substantial level of sophistication matching that of the spider silk fibers.” (Choresh et al. 2009:2852)\n",
      "“Biological materials function in environments where seasonal and even daily changes in conditions have the potential to alter the properties and performance of these materials. This study is the first to examine how changes in environmental humidity affect the extensibility of droplets, which are responsible for the adhesion of viscous capture threads that are produced by over 4000 species of orb-weaving spiders in the Araneoidea clade. These threads form an orb web’s sticky prey capture spiral, which retains insects that strike the web, providing a spider with more time to locate and subdue their prey. Viscous threads are comprised of small, regularly spaced aqueous droplets that surround a pair of supporting axial fibers and are produced by a triad of spigots on each of a spider’s paired posterior spinnerets. The single flagelliform gland spigot of this triad produces an axial fiber and is flanked by two aggregate gland spigots, which coat this fiber with aqueous material. The coated axial fibers merge to form a contiguous pair of fibers surrounded initially by a sheath of viscous material. As a thread absorbs atmospheric moisture in the high humidity of the early morning hours, this material quickly condenses into a regular series of droplets whose size and spacing differ greatly among species.\n",
      "“The glycoprotein within each droplet that confers thread adhesion is encoded by two genes. The asg1 gene produces a 406-amino-acid protein, whose upstream region has a high proportion of charged amino acids, which are considered hydrophilic, and its repeating downstream region is similar to mucin, known to have adhesive properties. The asg2 gene produces a 714-amino-acid protein, whose upstream region is similar to known chitin-binding proteins, adapting it to adhere to insect exoskeleton, whereas its repeating downstream region has high proline content that resembles that of elastin and flagelliform spider silk, making it elastic. This combination of features confers adhesion, extensibility and hygroscopicity to the glycoprotein–crucial and complementary properties in the context viscous thread performance.” (Opell et al. 2011:2988)\n",

Some bounced off the web without sticking at all. Others, which did not change direction upon impact, slid momentarily over the web’s surface, only to flutter free when they reached the edge. They all left impact marks on the webs where scales became detached to the viscid strands. Moth scars we came to call such telltale sites, and soon learned that they were common.” (Eisner 2003:218-220) [In the photographs of p. 219 of this book, he shows wing scales of a moth and empty sockets left after the scales detached.]\n",

In high-rainfall places or seasons, a high proportion of species were observed with nodding, pollen-concealed flowers or upward-facing flowers capable of temporary closure through perianth movements to avoid pollen loss (Dafni, 1996; Bynum & Smith, 2001; Huang et al., 2002; Hase et al., 2006). In bowl-shaped flowers exposed to rain, the petals are often separate or fused only at the base, so that raindrops flow quickly away between the petals, comprising a water drainage system. Sympetalous flowers are often pendulous and rarely erect. Erect sympetalous flowers usually have a narrow corolla. Morning glory flowers (Convolvulaceae) seem exceptional, with a wide open corolla, but they are generally ephemeral and secund. We observed that the corolla of Calystegia sepium closed on rainy days. Such floral changes may function to shelter pollen from rain damage before pollinators arrive. Extended pollen presentation duration in rain and the restoration of flower performance in fine weather involve reproductive costs that could otherwise have been invested in seed production. If we recognize that rain affects floral evolution, it is apparent that increased variability of precipitation may have potential effects on plant diversity and distribution in a given area.” (Mao and Huang 2009:898)\n",

Quantified kinematic variables included the tail-beat frequency, stride length (l), caudal amplitude, yaw, the propulsive wavelength, the speed of the propulsive wave (C) and the sweepback angle of the pectoral fins. In general, all variables, except the propulsive wavelength and consequently C, are comparable to values determined for other teleosts. The propulsive wavelength for the tunas (1.23–1.29L, where L is fork length) is 30–60 % longer than in other cruise-adapted teleosts such as salmonids. The resulting thunniform swimming mode and the morphological and anatomical adaptations associated with the long propulsive wavelength (e.g. fusiform body shape, rigid vertebral column) act to minimize anterior resistance and maximize caudal thrust. The long propulsive wavelength also increases the maximum l which, in concert with the elevated muscle temperatures of tunas, increases their maximum swimming velocity.” (Dewar and Graham 1994:45)\n",

In trees, the wood or xylem, of which only the newest and outermost annual ring actually conducts water, is in the form of a solid cylinder whose rigidity is able to support large crowns of leaves and branches. Vines need to be more flexible to cope with the twists and turns of climbing or the stresses that result when they partly or completely slip away from their supports. Woody vines achieve flexibility by having a considerable amount of soft tissue as well as wood in their stems. In some, the cylinder of wood is divided into segments that alternate with soft tissue; in others, there are alternating cylinders of wood and soft tissue.

The walls of these organs have, like nematodes, longitudinal muscles and connective tissue fibers in crossed-helical arrays, as in figure 20.4. Their fiber angles are high–about 67 degrees for fully extended feet–so tube feet also lie on the left side of the curve of figure 20.2. Contraction of muscle tries to shorten a foot and increase that angle still further, pushing it downward on the curve.

Adults, obligate predators on gelatinous plankton, encounter cold water at depth (<1280 m) or high latitude and are gigantotherms that maintain elevated core body temperatures in cold water. This study shows that there are great ontogenetic changes in tracheal structure related to diving and exposure to cold. Hatchling leatherbacks have a conventional reptilian tracheal structure with circular cartilaginous rings interspersed with extensive connective tissue. The adult trachea is an almost continuous ellipsoidal cartilaginous tube composed of interlocking plates, and will collapse easily in the upper part of the water column during dives, thus avoiding pressure-related structural and physiological problems. It is lined with an extensive, dense erectile vascular plexus that will warm and humidify cold inspired air and possibly retain heat on expiration. A sub-luminal lymphatic plexus is also present. Mammals and birds have independently evolved nasal turbinates to fulfil such a respiratory thermocontrol function; for them, turbinates are regarded as diagnostic of endothermy. This is the first demonstration of a turbinate equivalent in a living reptile.” (Davenport et al. 2009:3440)\n",

Various triterpenoids, acylglycerides, and flavonoids have been found in the R. gorgonias adhesive secretion. The secretion is water-insoluble and capable of maintaining ovoid or spherical shape and adhesive properties even under water. The pellucid secretion droplets have been observed to retain their properties for an indefinitely long time on dead and dried-up leaves or even on leaves preserved in formalin.

Such consistency of secretion probably contributes to its visco-elastic properties. The resin obviously functions as the adhesive component of the efficient insect trap. (2) Since resin droplets, released on trichome tips, are shiny and glistening, they attract insects prior to their capture. (3) As mentioned earlier, such a shiny surface also enhances light reflection therewith supporting the reduction of leaf temperature in a hot environment. (4) The hydrophobic nature of the secretion results in the reduction of water loss. (5) The robustness of the secretion to abiotic environmental factors could lead to saving energy, because of lower glandular activity necessary to fulfill the aforementioned functions. The renewal of the secretion is very limited, as we have observed in previous studies on adhesion of R. gorgonias trichomes.

Spider silk is therefore a model polymer for development of high performance biomimetic fibers…We examined the biomechanical properties of silk produced by the remarkable Malagasy ‘Darwin’s bark spider’ (Caerostris darwini), which we predicted would produce exceptional silk based upon its amazing web. The spider constructs its giant orb web (up to 2.8 m2) suspended above streams, rivers, and lakes. It attaches the web to substrates on each riverbank by anchor threads as long as 25 meters. Dragline silk from both Caerostris webs and forcibly pulled silk, exhibits an extraordinary combination of high tensile strength and elasticity previously unknown for spider silk. The toughness of forcibly silked fibers averages 350 MJ m3, with some samples reaching 520 MJ/m3.

They absorb solar light, converting its energy into electricity (electrochemical energy) for water splitting and the generation of chemical energy carriers. Excessive heating of leaves to temperatures above 40 – 45ºC can seriously damage the chemical structure and the function of biomolecules and, therefore, such high temperatures should be avoided, for example, the potato leaf does not tolerate temperatures above 40ºC. Nature has consequently developed a series of adaptations, which help leaves control the temperature. One is, of course, water evaporation, which, however, is restricted to areas with sufficient water supply. Another strategy is to keep the heat capacity low by means of building very light leaf structures so that the accumulated heat can easily be transferred to the atmospheric environment. It is also known that the leaf size decreases geographically with increasing solar energy input.” (Zähr et al. 2010: 285)\n",

The structure of this layer is three-dimensional, with a network of filamentary strings, arranged in layers parallel to the cuticle surface and stiffening an array of strong cylindrical pillars oriented normal to the surface.

When they first form, these pods, like other bean pods are green and soft, but as they ripen they become woody and heavy. Eventually, the pod falls into the river beside which the tree is growing and floats away. The pod breaks apart along thin grooves that run across it between the seeds. Each seed, with its own section of pod as packaging, then starts its own individual journey. Some may be stranded on a sand bank or a muddy beach within a few yards of their parents. But others regularly float down the whole length of the river, past the mangrove swamps around its estuary and on out to sea. By the time the seed gets washed up on a beach it may have lost every vestige of its pod, but even after a year at sea, it can still be viable.

This is approximately the optical window in which solar light is transmitted and reflected by green vegetation. Simultaneously, the tree bark is highly absorbing and thus radiation emitting between 6 and 10 [microns]. These two properties, mainly provided by tannins, create optimal conditions for radiative temperature control. In addition, tannins seem to have adopted a function as mediators for excitation energy towards photo-antioxidative activity for control of radiation damage.” (Henrion and Tribusch 2009:98)\n",
      "“Optimal reflection of incoming radiation is not the only condition for keeping surfaces cool. The second condition, optimal emission at a temperature that the object reaches (approximately 40 ºC) has also been demonstrated here. Barks, through tannin and cellulose, efficiently absorb radiation between 6 and 10 [microns] (Figs. 10, top and 12), which means that they emit radiation equally well in this wavelength region. It allows efficient thermal emission into the cool space via an optical atmospheric window between 7.5 and 13 [microns] (Fig. 6). Since leaves also have to cool down efficiently and therefore also have to emit radiation in this infrared optical window, it can be speculated that cellulose and tannins have been evolved, adopted, and applied because of their radiation properties. This could have been at least one of several evolutionary factors. As already mentioned the optical properties of tree barks are of course not the only factor that has been considered by evolution with respect to the heat balance of the tree bark. Many tree barks show a paper-like structure with sheets peeling off, generating highly heat-insulating, trapped air spaces between them (e.g. birch, paper-bark tree). Other tree barks have developed a very rough surface that produces a lot of shadowed areas amongst the illuminated ones [11]. Such a morphology is known to stimulate convection of air, which then transports away heat from the bark surface. An additional fact or that has been considered by evolution was, as already mentioned, the structure of tree stems and branches. They typically have a round profile, minimizing the surface with respect to the volume. For that reason, comparatively little solar heat can come in from the outside.” (Henrion and Tribusch 2009: 104-5)\n",

      "“A terrestrial slug doesn’t so much crawl as slide across its world on its belly (technically its foot) leaving behind a trail of slime–its pedal mucus, consisting of water with some polysaccharide and protein. It’s neither a cheap nor a rapid way to go, a slug being the very paradigm of sluggishness. It is (or, strictly, was) a mysterious business. Slugs use neither cilia (as push the mucus lining our respiratory passages) nor peristaltic motion (as do, for instance, earthworms). How they propel themselves turns out to depend on that mucus, in particular on viscoelastic behavior more complex than anything we’ve seen so far.\n",
      "The key can be seen if, with just the right lighting, one watches from beneath while a slug walks across a glass surface. Some kind of waves pass lengthwise; they’re about a millimeter or so in wavelength and travel at a couple of millimeters per second (fig. 17.7). It certainly looks as if the slug gets around by pushing back on its mucus, and that’s indeed what it does. But consider–that will work for one ‘step’ only. Any operating system that pushes needs to recover if it’s to push again…At strains above 5 or 6 (higher values at higher strain rates), the mucus abruptly yields, transforming in a flash into a gooey liquid with a viscosity of 3-5 pascal-seconds–three thousand to five thousand times the viscosity of pure water. Stress falls abruptly, dropping by half, and the stress-strain curve goes flat and horizontal–stress now depends only on strain rate, as befits a fluid. Thus, the mucus can be pushed upon, propelling the slug forward, but when nudged just beyond that yield stress it turns to liquid. Then a bit of slug can slide forward across it and be ready to push backward again. Meanwhile, and critically, the mucus has to recover, to ‘heal’ back into a viscoelastic solid, which it obligingly does forthwith. In life, a ‘step’ is about a millimeter in length and the mucus layer is about 10 micrometers thick, so the strain gets up to around 100 during the recovery phase of each pedal wave. Beneath a given slug at a given time, all stages of the operation are taking place, with mucus in different states under different points along the animal. All this from Denny and Gosline (1980) and Denny (1984).” (Vogel 2003:362-363)\n",

The relevant combination of density and kinematic viscosity of air is much lower than for water… Analysis of published and unpublished underwater film leads us to present a hypothesis that free-ranging emperor penguins employ air lubrication in achieving high, probably maximal, underwater speeds (mean ± SD: 5.3 ± 1.01 m s–1), prior to jumps. Here we show evidence that penguins dive to 15 to 20 m with air in their plumage and that this compressed air is released as the birds subsequently ascend whilst maintaining depressed feathers. Fine bubbles emerge continuously from the entire plumage, forming a smooth layer over the body and generating bubbly wakes behind the penguins… From simple physical models and calculations presented, we hypothesize that a significant proportion of the enhanced ascent speed is due to air lubrication reducing frictional and form drag, that buoyancy forces alone cannot explain the observed speeds…” (Davenport et al. 2011: 171)\n",
      "“Before jumping out of the water onto ice, the penguins swim at the surface and then dive on inspiration (Kooyman et al. 1971). We believe they dive with plenty of air in the plumage, with erected feathers making room for an air layer about 25 mm thick (following Du et al. 2007). Kooyman et al. (1971) described the grooming behaviour by which surface swimming emperor penguins load their plumage with air and we confirmed this by observation… They subsequently dive to ~15 to 20 m (by which depth the air volume will have decreased by a substantial amount…). During the dive, or when achieving that depth, they depress the feathers (to fix the plumage volume at the new, decreased level). When the birds swim quickly upwards, the decompressing air will flow out by virtue of the available fixed plumage volume being substantially less than the initial volume. Plumage consists of a fine, multi-layered mesh over the whole of the body surface comparable to a porous medium with an estimated pore size of <20 μm (Du et al. 2007), so the expanding air will automatically issue as small bubbles. This arrangement resembles the flat-plate experiments of Sanders et al. (2006), who used a 40 μm pore size sintered stainless steel strip for microbubble air injection. The ‘active’ part of the process consists solely of maintenance of depressed feathers during the near vertical phase of the ascent in order to regulate expulsion of air driven by decompression. As bubbles continue to enter the boundary layer along the plumage, they are swept downstream and move outwards, thus increasing the void fraction in the boundary layer downstream to finally leave in the wake behind the bird; or they coalesce with other bubbles to form rather large bubbles at the outer edge of the boundary layer…” (Davenport et al. 2011: 175-176)\n",

They form by spontaneous self-assembly inside the crowded, heterogeneous cytoplasm of infected cells. Self-assembly of viruses seems to obey the principles of thermodynamically reversible self-assembly but assembled shells (‘capsids’) strongly resist disassembly. Following assembly, some viral shells pass through a sequence of coordinated maturation steps that progressively strengthen the capsid. Viral shells have effective Young’s moduli ranging from that of polyethylene to that of plexiglas. Some of them can withstand internal osmotic pressures that are tens of atmospheres.” (Roos et al. 2010:733)\n",

This absence of metabolic and reproductive activity suggests that, unlike cells, the assembly of viruses could perhaps be understood on the basis of equilibrium thermodynamics…Capsid proteins, or ‘subunits’, interact mainly through a combination of electrostatic repulsion, hydrophobic attraction and specific contacts between certain pairs of amino acids (known as ‘Caspar pairs’)…Self-assembly of most infectious sphere-like ssRNA viruses under ambient conditions requires the presence of the viral RNA genome molecules. Viral RNA molecules act in part as a non-specific ‘electrostatic glue’ that links together the oppositely charged capsid proteins, and particular ‘stem-loop’ side branches of the RNA molecules have specific affinity for the capsid proteins…On the other hand, self-assembly of viral shells of most ds genomes, such as the tailed dsDNA ‘bacteriophage’ viruses (that is, viruses that prey on bacteria), does not require the presence of genome molecules. The much larger bending rigidity of dsDNA molecules presumably prevents them from acting as ‘electrostatic glue’. In these cases, the genome is usually inserted, after capsid assembly has been completed, by the action of a rotary molecular motor imbedded in the capsid.” (Roos et al. 2010:733-734)\n",

These are known as epiphytes and among the commonest are bromeliads. They anchor themselves by wrapping their roots around the branch. Their long leaves grow in a tight rosette around their central bud and channel rain water down to it so that the rosette fills and forms a small pond. This becomes a world in miniature. Leaves and other bits of vegetable detritus fall into it and decay. Birds and small mammals come to sip the water, and leave behind their nitrogen-rich droppings. Microscopic organisms of one kind or another develop in it, as they will do in any pool of standing water. Mosquitos lay rafts of eggs in its depths, though in much smaller numbers. In due course, a few dragonfly larvae will feed on a multitude of mosquito larvae. Small brilliantly coloured frogs that live nowhere else but in bromeliad ponds take up residence and spawn there. Crabs, salamanders, slugs, worms, beetles, lizards, even small snakes may all join the community.\n",

Their strange inflorescences consist of several thousand small florets massed together in a single spike and arranged in vertical lines, that in some species have a gentle spiral twist…They take several months to develop and then open over several weeks. Birds such as lorikeets and marsupials like the honey possum come to drink nectar from them and in the course of doing so pollinate them.

The local speeds developed at the tip of the wing are relatively high and, together with the corresponding moments, produce great dynamic stability. When viewed from above and below, the rotating wing sweeps out a shallow conical section with an area Ap (Figure 9.10). The angle subtending the longitudinal axis of the fruit or seed and the horizontal plane is the coning angle ß, the equilibrium condition between the centrifugal forces acting on the rotating wing (which produce a turning moment tending to force the wing into a horizontal position) and aerodynamic forces (which tend to displace the wing into the vertical position).

She then lays her eggs inside, and her mate, who has clung to her back throughout, fertilizes them. As the parents leave, the outer bubbles harden to form a protective case that encloses a foamy core of several thousand eggs. This foam nursery provides shelter from predators, bacteria, and sunlight, as well as preventing dehydration. Because the foam is mostly air it supplies all the embryos’ oxygen needs until well after hatching. The nest then disintegrates, and the young emerge from the crowded apartment and, all being well, drop into the water below.” (Downer 2002:54)\n",
      "“The foam nests of the túngara frog (Engystomops pustulosus) [formerly Physalaemus pustulosus] form a biocompatible incubation medium for eggs and sperm while resisting considerable environmental and microbiological assault. We have shown that much of this behaviour can be attributed to a cocktail of six proteins, designated ranaspumins (Rsn-1 to Rsn-6), which predominate in the foam. These fall into two discernable classes based on sequence analysis and biophysical properties. Rsn-2, with an amphiphilic amino acid sequence unlike any hitherto reported, exhibits substantial detergent-like surfactant activity necessary for production of foam, yet is harmless to the membranes of eggs and spermatozoa. A further four (Rsn-3 to Rsn-6) are lectins, three of which are similar to fucolectins found in teleosts but not previously identified in a land vertebrate, though with a carbohydrate binding specificity different from previously described fucolectins. The sixth, Rsn-1, is structurally similar to proteinase inhibitors of the cystatin class, but does not itself appear to exhibit any such activity. The nest foam itself, however, does exhibit potent cystatin activity. Rsn-encoding genes are transcribed in many tissues of the adult frogs, but the full cocktail is present only in oviduct glands. Combinations of lectins and cystatins have known roles in plants and animals for defence against microbial colonization and insect attack. Túngara nest foam displays a novel synergy of selected elements of innate defence plus a specialized surfactant protein, comprising a previously unreported strategy for protection of unattended reproductive stages of animals.” (Fleming et al. 2009:1787)\n",
      "“Frogs that build foam nests floating on water face the problems of over-dispersion of the secretions used and eggs being dangerously exposed at the foam : air interface. Nest construction behaviour of túngara frogs, Engystomops pustulosus [formerly Physalaemus pustulosus], has features that may circumvent these problems. Pairs build nests in periodic bursts of foam production and egg deposition, three discrete phases being discernible. The first is characterized by a bubble raft without egg deposition and an approximately linear increase in duration of mixing events with time. This phase may reduce initial over-dispersion of foam precursor materials until a critical concentration is achieved. The main building phase is marked by mixing events and start-to-start intervals being nearly constant in duration. During the final phase, mixing events do not change in duration but intervals between them increase in an exponential-like fashion. Pairs joining a colonial nesting abbreviate their initial phase, presumably by exploiting a pioneer pair’s bubble raft, thereby reducing energy and material expenditure, and time exposed to predators. Finally, eggs are deposited only in the centre of nests with a continuously produced, approximately 1 cm deep egg-free cortex that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests.” (Dalgetty & Kennedy 2010:293)\n",

Fibrous keratins evolved as a means of strengthening the integument while simultaneously providing a structural support for lipids, which comprise the principal barrier to cutaneous water efflux in terrestrial taxa…How do the structural features of keratin influence its resistance to water movement? Generally, structural features that alter the free volume (equivalent to pores or channels) should alter the permeation of water molecules accordingly. Resistance to diffusion is affected by the molecular mass of side chains and tends to increase with cross-linking beyond certain critical levels (Lieberman et al., 1972)…The stability of cross-linkages is dependent on a large number of intermolecular forces, including covalent, ionic, and hydrogen bonding in addition to van der Waals attractive forces between non-polar amino acid side chains. All of these act to influence the mobility and free volumes of the structure…Studies of human skin have indeed demonstrated that gradients of water exist in the stratum corneum (Warner et al., 1988; Bommannan et al., 1990; Caspers et al., 2001; Bouwstra et al., 2003a). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy has demonstrated that free water content in stratum corneum is greater in central regions relative to superficial and deeper cell layers at moderate levels of hydration (57%–87%, w/w), whereas at higher levels of hydration (300% w/w) water swells corneocytes in a direction perpendicular to the skin surface except for the deepest cell layers adjacent to the viable epidermis (Bouwstra et al., 2003a). While the mechanism excluding free water from the deeper cell layers of stratum corneum is not understood, it is speculated to play a role in preventing dehydration of the viable epidermis. In relatively dry conditions (18%–26% w/w), only bound water is present in the stratum corneum (Bulgin and Vinson, 1967; Hansen and Yellin, 1972; Bouwstra et al., 2003a).” (Lillywhite 2006:202, 212, 213)\n",

      "“The antennae of male mosquitoes and midges are also adapted to find females of their kind, but in a different way. The brush-like male antennae are sensitive to sound waves, particularly to those of the frequency of the wingbeat of females; so when a male midge ‘hears’ a female with his antennae, he flies towards the source of the good vibrations. The response is so simple that the insect will be attracted to anything producing vibrations at the correct frequency (even a tuning-fork)…” (Foy and Oxford Scientific Films 1982:133)\n",
      "“The antennae of male mosquitoes demonstrate obvious structural modi?cations that are absent from the antennae of females. In addition to differences in the structure of Johnston’s organ proper, the ?agellum of the male antenna is plumose, bearing whorls of extremely long and thin ?agellar sensory hairs (also called ?brils). Since the length of these hairs decreases continuously towards the antennal tip, the shape of the male mosquito antenna is reminiscent of a Christmas tree. It has been proposed that antennal hairs are a prerequisite for acoustic sensitivity since, in the males of some mosquito species, for which acoustic communication could not be demonstrated, such antennal anatomy is absent.” (Gopfert 1991: 2727-28)\n",

      " “The fact that the antennal hairs resonate at higher frequencies only indicates that they are stiffly coupled to the shaft. Experimentally, this is illustrated by the fact that the hairs vibrate relative to the shaft only when stimulated at frequencies above 1000 Hz. When stimulated at biologically relevant frequencies (350–500 Hz), the hairs undergo a displacement that is in phase with that of the shaft, suggesting that the biologically signi?cant mechanical property of the hairs is to provide a stiff coupling between the vibrations of the hairs and those of the shaft. In this way, forces acting on the hairs are effectively transmitted to the shaft and therefore to Johnston’s organ.” (Gopfert 1991: 2737)\n",

      "“Dragonflies flap and pitch their wings at a rate of about 40 Hz, creating whirlwinds as illustrated in figure 2 [see online paper listed in references]. A peculiarity of the dragonfly is its use of a rowing motion along an inclined stroke plane. During hovering, the body lies almost horizontal. The wings push backward and downward, and at the end of the stroke, feather and slice upward and forward. In contrast, many other hovering insects use a symmetrical back-and-forth stroke near a horizontal stroke plane. The dragonfly’s asymmetric rowing motion allows it to support much of its weight by the upward drag created during the downstroke; for the more common symmetric motion, the drag roughly cancels.\n",
      "“The dragonfly belongs to Odonata, one of the most ancient of insect orders. Its fore and hind wings are controlled by separate muscles, and a distinctive feature of the dragonfly’s wing movement is the phase relation between those wings during various maneuvers. When hovering, the fore and hind wings tend to beat out of phase; during takeoff, they tend to beat closer in phase. Why does a dragonfly vary the phase in different maneuvers? One plausible explanation is that alternating the downstroke reduces body oscillation. That is, however, only part of the story. The fore and hind wings are about a wing-width apart—close enough for them to interact hydrodynamically. To determine the amount of interaction, one solves the Navier–Stokes flow equations with boundary conditions set by the movement of the wings. The resulting flows are spectacular and complex. They depend on Reynolds number, wing motion, wing shape, and phase difference.\n",
      "“Despite that complexity, two general results emerge: The aerodynamic power expended is reduced when the wings move out of phase, and the force is enhanced when the wings move in phase. When the fore and hind wings beat out of phase, they approach each other from opposite sides and cross near the midstroke. The fore wings experience an induced flow due to the hind wings, and vice versa. As a consequence, the drag on the wings is reduced, as is the power expended in flapping. But the reduction in drag on the two types of wing points in opposite directions, so the net force is essentially unaffected. In other words, the counterstroking allows the dragonfly to generate nearly the same force while saving aerodynamic power. If, instead, the fore and hind wings beat in phase, they will experience a higher drag due to the induced flow. In this case the increase in drag on all the wings points in the same direction. Thus the hydrodynamic interaction results in a greater net force that can be used to accelerate as needed during takeoff. The cost is greater power expenditure.” (Wang 2008:74)\n",

      "“Activation of Factor X is a common point between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation [1]. Activated factor X (FXa) is the sole enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin into thrombin, the key enzyme in the coagulation cascade; therefore inhibitors of this step are of considerable mechanistic and pharmacological interest. In addition to the two known physiological inhibitors of this serine protease, antithrombin III (AT-III) and the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), several low molecular mass naturally occurring polypeptides inhibitors have been described, such as Antistasin, a 119-residue protein isolated from the mexican leech Haementeria offcinalis [2,3]; the tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP) [4], a 60-amino acid protein derived from the tick Ornithodoros moubata; Ecotin, a periplasmic protein found in Escherichia coli [5-7]; and the Ancylostoma caninum anticoagulant peptide (AcAP) [8]. These peptides behave as reversible, slow tight-binding inhibitors of FXa, where Antistasin and Ecotin are slowly cleaved by FXa, while TAP is not affected by the protease. Recently, we described a new natural FXa inhibitor, isolated from the saliva of the vampire bat Desmodus rotundus, which was named Draculin. Draculin is a 88.5 kDa glycoprotein which selectively inhibits both FXa and activated factor IX (FIXa) [9]. Furthermore, the anticoagulant activity of Draculin is highly dependent on the proper glycosylation of the polypeptide backbone [10]. The results described in this paper indicate that, in contrast to other natural FXa inhibitors, Draculin behaves as a noncompetitive, tight-binding inhibitor of FXa.” (Fernandez et al. 1999:135-136)\n",

      "“The sides of a mountain goat’s toes consist of the same hard keratin found on the hoof of a horse or deer. Each of the two wrap around toenails can be used to catch and hold to a crack or tiny knob of rock…The mountain goat is shod with a special traction pad which protrudes slightly past the nail. This pad has a rough textured surface that provides a considerable amount of extra friction on smooth rock and ice. Yet it is pliant enough for any irregularities in a stone substrate to become impressed in it and thereby add to the skidproofing effect.” (Chadwick 1983: 50)\n",
      "“Make a wide V with your index and middle fingers and try pressing down against something with their tips. Since walking on an artiodactyl hoof is anatomically similar to walking on the tips of two fingers, the mountain goat feels the muscles and tendons working against each other somewhat the way you do. It adjusts the tensions accordingly in order to fine-tune its grip on uneven surfaces…Now you will find that the more weight you put on your fingertips, the more they want to diverge sideways. In like fashion the mountain goat’s toes divide the downward force of the weight on a hoof. When your fingers, or the toes of the hoof, are placed on an incline surface, part of the weight continues to be directed sideways—a horizontal vector of force as distinct from the vertical vector. There is thus less net force being exerted in a singe downward line; hence there is less likelihood of overcoming the force of friction along that line and beginning to slide…What is going on here is a fanning out of forces. If all the downward force could be converted into sideways forces, it would in effect be canceled out…The third and final dimension is simpler to explain. Solid rock, talus, dirt or snow can become wedged in the crotch of the V and act as an additional brake.” (Chadwick 1983: 51)\n",

Rounded tubercles were regularly interspersed along the flipper’s leading edge. The flipper was cut into 71 2.5-cm cross-sections and photographed. Except for sections near the distal tip, flipper sections were symmetrical with no camber. Flipper sections had a blunt, rounded leading edge and a highly tapered trailing edge.

The morphology and placement of leading edge tubercles suggest that they function as enhanced lift devices to control flow over the flipper and maintain lift at high angles of attack.

      "“It will be a surprise to many biologists that snails are found in large numbers on the dry, barren surfaces of certain hot deserts. The present study is concerned with one such snail, Sphincterochila boissieri, which occurs in the deserts of the Near East. Live specimens of this snail, withdrawn in the shell and dormant, can be found on the desert surface in mid-summer, fully exposed to sun and heat. The surface temperature of these deserts may reach 70 °C and more than a year may pass between rains…\n",

      "“The maximum air temperature, reached at noon, was 42.6 °C, and the maximum soil surface temperature in the sun, reached at 13.00, was 65.3 °C. Under the snail, in the space between the soil surface and the smooth shell, the maximum temperature was 60.1 °C, or 5.2 °C below the adjacent soil surface in the open sun. The lower temperature under the shell is expected, for the shell provides shade for that particular spot of the soil surface on which it sits. Inside the shell in the largest whorl, located in contact with the ground, the maximum temperature was 56.2 °C. In the second and third whorls the temperature was lower, reaching a maximum of 50.3 °C.\n",

      "“Why does the snail not heat up to the same temperature as the soil surface? The answer lies in its high reflectivity in combination with the slow conduction of heat from the substrate. Within the visible part of the solar spectrum (which contains about one-half of the total incident solar radiant energy) the reflectance of these snails is about 90%. In the near infrared, up to 1350 nm, the reflectance is similar to that of magnesium oxide and is estimated to be 95%. In the total range of the solar spectrum, therefore, we can say that the snails reflect well over 90% of the incident radiant energy.\n",
      "“…heat flow, however, is impeded by two important circumstances. Firstly, the snail shell is in direct contact with the rough soil surface only in a few spots, and a layer of still air separates much of its bottom surface from the ground, forming an insulatng [sic] air cushion. Next, and perhaps more important, the snail is withdrawn into the upper parts of the shell and the largest whorl is filled with air; this constitutes a further impediment to heat flow into the snail.” (Schmidt-Nielsen et al. 1971:385, 388-9)\n",

      "“Bacteria swarming behavior in colonies was explained by considering attractive and repulsive forces between colony parts, communication capabilities, physical interactions between cells, and forces from the environment. Bacteria navigate using chemotaxis, i.e., moving according to gradients in the chemical concentration. Bacteria are too small to detect the chemical gradients across their body receptors, and thus detect the concentration as they swim, and delay their tumble if the concentration increases. As a result, they make longer excursions towards areas of higher concentration. Each bacterium may only acquire local and partial cues from the environment, but as a group bacteria can navigate through challenging environments.” (Shklarsh et al. 2011:1–2)\n",

But bacteria communicate differently, through molecular, chemical and mechanical means, and can avoid this pitfall.\n",
      "Based on confidence in their own information and decisions, ‘bacteria can adjust their interactions with their peers,’ Prof. Ben-Jacob says. ‘When an individual bacterium finds a more beneficial path, it pays less attention to the signals from the other cells. But at other times, upon encountering challenging paths, the individual cell will increase its interaction with the other cells and learn from its peers. Since each of the cells adopts the same strategy, the group as a whole is able to find an optimal trajectory in an extremely complex terrain.’” (Hunka 2011:1)\n",

      "“The foam nests of the túngara frog (Engystomops pustulosus) [formerly  Physalaemus pustulosus] form a biocompatible incubation medium for eggs and sperm while resisting considerable environmental and microbiological assault. We have shown that much of this behaviour can be attributed to a cocktail of six proteins, designated ranaspumins (Rsn-1 to Rsn-6), which predominate in the foam. These fall into two discernable classes based on sequence analysis and biophysical properties. Rsn-2, with an amphiphilic amino acid sequence unlike any hitherto reported, exhibits substantial detergent-like surfactant activity necessary for production of foam, yet is harmless to the membranes of eggs and spermatozoa. A further four (Rsn-3 to Rsn-6) are lectins, three of which are similar to fucolectins found in teleosts but not previously identified in a land vertebrate, though with a carbohydrate binding specificity different from previously described fucolectins. The sixth, Rsn-1, is structurally similar to proteinase inhibitors of the cystatin class, but does not itself appear to exhibit any such activity. The nest foam itself, however, does exhibit potent cystatin activity. Rsn-encoding genes are transcribed in many tissues of the adult frogs, but the full cocktail is present only in oviduct glands. Combinations of lectins and cystatins have known roles in plants and animals for defence against microbial colonization and insect attack. Túngara nest foam displays a novel synergy of selected elements of innate defence plus a specialized surfactant protein, comprising a previously unreported strategy for protection of unattended reproductive stages of animals.” (Fleming et al. 2009:1787)\n",

The body wall of a sea anemone–which can be quite substantial in size–consists of inner and outer surface layers separated by the thick mesoglea. One doesn’t go far wrong viewing the system as a tall can of seawater whose walls are mostly made of jelly…A typical anemone has a rare facility for changing shape, ranging from a low barrel to a tall cylinder with a few flourishes in between, over times ranging from seconds to hours…Obviously its mesogleal stuffing must participate in the process. Muscle drives some of the shape changes, in particular the sudden expulsion of water in the central cavity from its single apical opening. But tracts of cilia drive other changes, such as reinflation by pumping water back in. You may recall that…ciliary pumps produce exceedingly low pressures, and here we’re asking that they pump up creatures that may reach half a meter in height and live in moving water.\n",
      "Alexander (1962) showed the crucial role of mesogleal viscoelasticity for anemones. In creep tests on samples, strain increased from an initial value of about 0.2 to a final level ten times that, achieved after around 10 hours. That means the mesoglea has a lot of viscosity relative to its elasticity–it’s hard to make it do anything fast but fairly easy to make it change shape slowly. It has a retardation time (calculated by Biggs; see Vincent [1990]) of a little under an hour. How nice! The pulsating or reversing flows of waves passing above won’t sweep it about very much, but after it has hunkered down, the low-pressure ciliary pump will be adequate to pump it back up again, albeit slowly. It can stand up to a single wave but deflect in a tidal current that imposes the same drag. Furthermore, the anemone’s body wall can resist the stresses of its own short-term muscle contractions, so it can bend or straighten without getting an aneurysm whenever its muscles aren’t active.” (Vogel 2003:360-361)\n",

We speculate, rather, that Cr(VI) reduction is used here as a detoxification mechanism…Both of the common Cr(VI) anions, chromate (CrO42-) and dichromate (Cr2O72-), are strong oxidants, and chromate is a known carcinogen and a suspected mutagen and teratogen…it may cause oxidative or other cellular damage such as DNA breakage…The chromate oxyanion, due to its negative charge and high solubility, tends to be highly mobile and bioavailable. By contrast, Cr(III) often forms insoluble hydroxides at circum-neutral pH, and its toxicity and mobility are negligible under these conditions. Because of this decrease in solubility, toxicity, and mobility, reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is considered a beneficial reaction in many Cr-contaminated environments…Many Cr-contaminated habitats are acidic, including acid mine drainage and numerous industrial or government sites.” (Cummings 2007:146).\n",

In the first, Cr(VI) is directly reduced by cellular components…a role for cellular proteins in the process…By the second mechanism, Fe(III) is enzymatically reduced to Fe(II), which rapidly shuttles its electron to Cr(VI), reducing it to Cr(III) in three 1-electron transfers…The kinetics of Fe(III) reduction by A. cryptum appear to be much more rapid than those of direct Cr(VI) reduction, and the rate of abiotic reduction of Cr(VI) by Fe(II) is considerably faster than many enzymatic processes, so an indirect mechanism is likely to dominate the Cr(VI) reduction pathway in the presence of reducible Fe(III)…Reduction of Cr(VI) is not linked to energy conservation by A. cryptum. Instead, Cr(VI) reduction by A. cryptum may be a detoxification strategy. The toxicity of Cr(VI) is due in part to the solubility and reactivity of the chromate anion, CrO42-. At circumneutral pH, reduction to Cr(III) leads to its precipitation as insoluble Cr(OH)3. The diminished toxicity of Cr(III) is assumed to be largely the result of the limited solubility of the trivalent hydroxide. As pH drops, however, the solubility of Cr(III) increases. Yet, its toxicity appears to be greatly diminished despite the elevated aqueous concentration…although Cr(III) remains predominantly soluble (or biomass-associated) under acidic conditions, it is nonetheless considerably less toxic to A. cryptum than Cr(VI).” (Cummings 2007:150).\n",

Esterified cutin components represented about 80% of the cuticle and di-hydroxyhexadecanoic acids were the major monomers of cutin, regardless of origin. The cutin of elastic tissues is characterized by a higher content of tri-hydroxy monomers than the cutin of rigid tissues.

Because a similar decrease in the relative amount of the trihydroxy C18 monomers occurred during cuticle development in ripening tomatoes, elasticity appears to be associated with a higher number of hydroxyl groups. The higher amount of trihydroxy monomers in the cuticle of elastic tissue argues for increased hydration of such cuticle and against the potential for increased cross-linking capability, which would reduce flexibility.” (Marga et al. 2001:846)\n",

Contrary to the notion that more hydroxyl groups can serve as potential sites for cross-linking, the OH groups apparently determine the hydrophilicity of the cuticle and facilitate impregnation with water.

Similar to the strengthening of the cell wall by lignins, the cuticle can also be expected to gain mechanical strength by increased cross-linking of phenolic compounds.

Similar to high order polymers like dendrimers, which are nanometer-sized macromolecules with regular units, the lipids form regular layers with a thickness of 100 nm. The lipid layers insulate the scattering of collisional energy and direct the energy towards the IR-absorbing tulip-shaped protein region. Protein hydrogen bonds vibrate in response to infrared radiation at wavelengths around 3 µm and at wavelengths between 10 µm and 25 µm. This stretch resonance corresponds at 3 µm with the data for maximal IR absorption as well as with behavioral and sensory response of the Melanophila acuminata.

Here we describe how the flower stamens of the bunchberry dogwood (Cornus canadensis) rely on this principle to catapult pollen into the air as the flower opens explosively. Our high-speed video observations show that the flower opens in less than 0.5 ms — to our knowledge, the fastest movement so far recorded in a plant.”\n",

It opens and shuts about once a second, and withstands a pressure difference of 100 mm of mercury when closed. It usually functions for 70 yr without failure, and works so efficiently that very little blood is regurgitated at each pulse. In order to support this large pressure difference, the cusps must close simultaneously in all operating conditions and should not touch the wall of the aorta, for considerable reversed flow would then be required to close the valve.

      "“Postelsia palmaeformis–the scientific name makes the same allusion as the common name, ‘sea palm’–lives in the lower intertidal zones of rocky, wave-swept shore on the west coast of North America. The plant, shown in figure 21.4, never reaches a meter in height, so it’s not exactly a big tree. But, like trees, it has three parts, an attachment (holdfast), a column (stipe), and photosynthetic laminae (fronds). It stands against gravity, getting higher in dense stands, and it bends in response to lateral force, for it, waves. Unlike any tree, though, it responds to lateral force by bending until almost prostrate and then springing back upright. Concomitantwith that untreelike behavior are a set of most untreelike material properties, set out in a lovely paper by Holbrook, Denny, and Koehl (1991). Table 21.1 lists these, along with typical values for wood.\n",
      "“Postelsia‘s ‘trunk’ certainly looks wimpy next to wood. It gives rather than standing tall in the face of fierce force, getting from a high second moment of area just enough flexural stiffness to stand erect at all. Only in work of extension does it play in the same league as wood, although it gets its high value by quite a different tactic–high stretchiness instead of high strength. Regaining its erect posture depends on reinvesting that work of extension, which requires a high resilience, which it has. But, as Holbrook, Denny, and Koehl emphasized, the energy storage underlying that resilience undermines its toughness. Postelsia is notably brittle and sensitive to scratches–its stipe may be soft, but cracks propagate all too readily. Before dismissing this alga as just a lowly tree wannabe, bear in mind that it has extraordinarily high photosynthetic productivity and that it invests far more, proportionately, in photosynthetic organs than any ordinary tree. Its fronds represent no less than 38 percent of its energy content or 35 percent of its weight (Lawrence and McClintock 1988)–compare this with the trivial weight and burning yield of the annual leaf-fall of a tree that yields a cord or so (perhaps 2 metric tons) of dry firewood.” (Vogel 2003:434-435)\n",

      "(5-10 MPa) of stipe tissue; in spite of the weakness (low breaking stress, ~ 1 MPa) of this tissue, a large amount of energy ( ~ 100 kJ/m 3) is required to break a stipe because they can be extended by 20-25 % before breaking. Although made of such easily deformed tissue, Postelsia can stand upright in air due to the width (high second moment of area) and resilience of their stipes, but the brittleness (low work of fracture, 400-900 J/m 2) that accompanies this resilience renders them susceptible to breakage if they sustain deep scratches. Although wave-induced stresses experienced by individuals in aggregations are not lower than those experienced by isolated sea-palms, photon flux densities of photosynthetically active radiation within these dense groves are less than 10% of those above Postelsia canopies. A number of morphological features differ between canopy, understory, and isolated individuals. Canopy plants in dense aggregations are taller than isolated individuals and may exceed limiting proportions for elastic stability. Postelsia shows photosynthetic characteristics of “shade-adapted” plants, understory individuals being especially effective at using low light. Despite this, blade growth rates of understory plants are lower than those of either canopy or isolated individuals.” (Holbrook et al. 1991:39)\n",

Genome sequencing has dramatically confirmed this hypothesis, as the retained bacterial gene sets strongly suggest that the symbionts supply the host with compounds that are lacking in their diet. Bacterial symbionts are particularly common in insects that feed exclusively on plant sap, whether it is phloem, which is relatively rich in carbohydrates but poor in amino acids and vitamins, or xylem, which is limited in carbohydrates, amino acids, and vitamins.” (McCutcheon et al. 2009:15394)\n",

Hodgkinia” is harbored in the central bacteriocytes of Py. repanda. The localization of “Ca. Sulcia” and “Ca. Hodgkinia” within the bacteriocytes of Py. repanda is generally similar to previous observations of a few other cicada species (27–29). In comparison with the majority of auchenorrhynchan insects, cicadas develop a similar mechanism of transovarial transmission for the primary symbionts from one generation to the next. We clarified that Arsenophonus together with these two primary symbionts were released from the bacteriocytes into the hemolymph of cicadas, gathered around the posterior pole of the oocytes, emigrated through the cytoplasm of the follicular epithelium into the perivitelline space, and finally formed a characteristic symbiont ball in each egg.” (Huang et al. 2020:10)\n",

On rainy days, pine cones fold their scales to prevent seeds from spreading under humid weather whereas on a sunny dry day, these scales gape open to release the seeds. This strategy promotes the survival of a species by dispersing seeds for propagation at greater distance. … However, scales of pine cones consist of dead cells. … Then, how can they move?

Seaside arrowgrass forms clumps up to 2 m wide and 60 cm high. Waterlogging of the plant’s roots stimulates production of shallow roots that spread out at or above the surface, resulting in outward expansion of the clumps. As the clumps expand outward beyond about 40 cm, the interior shoots die out, resulting in a ring of seaside arrowgrass around a decomposing center. … The rings have higher organic content and lower water content than the surrounding substrate. The increased height of the rings is the main mechanism behind the increased diversity because with greater height, there is greater reductive potential, reduced salinity, and increased habitat heterogeneity.”\n",

It stretches out its long, flexible, sticky, feeding tentacles crosswise to flow…like the main cables of an extension bridge but loaded by drag instead of gravity. According to Johnson (1993), extended straight from animal to anchor point, the tentacles could not withstand much drag. But by a combination of passive sagging and muscular activity, they extend ever farther as flow increases. Drag may increase with flow, but the tentacle-stretching tensile consequence of drag does not–tension in the tentacles remains almost constant over at least a sevenfold speed range.” (Vogel 2003:329)\n",
      "Tentacles suspended perpendicular to flow responded to increasing velocity by increasing their sag. An analysis of tension in these tentacles, mathematically analogous to that applicable to suspension bridges, shows that sagging permits the tentacles to avoid increases in tension that would otherwise occur as flow increases. Force modulation was achieved by active muscular control rather than by passive material properties. Although these tentacles would certainly break in the experimental flows if they did not sag, the low tension achieved suggests that some other reason, such as limitations on the adherence of cilia and mucus, accounts for the level of tension observed. Because drag is maximum on tentacles oriented perpendicular to flow, reorientation of tentacles, either by sagging or by dangling parallel to flow, additionally reduces tension by reducing drag. Theoretical estimates of drag on tentacles oriented parallel to flow show that they are never in danger of being broken. Drag is sufficient, however, to assist in passive extension of tentacles. While reorientation is a common mode of drag reduction among marine organisms, sagging represents a novel mechanism of mediating structural forces resulting from flow.\n",

Normally these worms form severely flattened cylinders; the fibers in their surface layers lie at angles to their long axes somewhere in the 40-70 degree range. Since they’re not circular cylinders, they contain less volume than they might, and they live beneath the curve of figure 20.2, in the region labeled ‘flaccid.’ If such a worm contracts longitudinal muscles it will get shorter, moving to the left along a horizontal line. Sufficient contraction will bring it up against the curve, where it finds itself circular in section and more turgid to boot. If the worm contracts circumferential muscles it gets longer, moving to the right, but again it gets more nearly circular and more turgid. Not all of these worms can change shape enough to hit the limiting line, but they all use this curious scheme in which shape and stiffness are predictably interrelated.

Much of that energy comes as chemically inert cellulose, which mammals hydrolyze only by enlisting symbiotic microorganisms in rumen or intestine. It’s full of abrasive stuff like silicon dioxide and has lengthwise fibers that demand cross-wise chewing rather than rapid tearing. Long-lived grazers, concomitantly, have especially special teeth, with their components typically layered side by side, as in figure 16.5b.
